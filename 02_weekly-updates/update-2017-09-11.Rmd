# Sam's Slides

## ICFIS Workshop 

Title: "Elements of Forensic Science for Forensic Practitioners"

Lessons learned:

- Siloization - different disciplines have own language and terms 
- "Hierarchy of Propositions"
    * Source level - is a person the source of the evidence? (CSAFE can help most here, imho)
    * Activity level - how did that evidence get there (investigators)
    * Offense level - did a criminal act occur? (judicial system)

## ICFIS Workshop (cont'd) {.smaller}

More lessons learned: 

- Generic Model for forensic evidence analysis
    1. Feature selection (relevant & useful features)
    2. Distortion assessment (intra-source variability; which differences matter?)
    3. "Matching" step (correspondence; how strong of a match?)
    4. "Significance" of the "match" (discriminability; how discriminating is the "match"?)
    5. Decision (reporting; LR, frequency, categorical scale?)
    6. Quality control (verification, technical review)
    
## ICFIS Workshop, Fingerprints
    
- Fingerprint evidence protocol ACE-V
    * Analysis - information gathering step (1 + 2 above)
    * Comparison - side-by-side of latent v. known (3 + 4 above)
    * Evaluation - decision making (5 above)
    * Verification - 2nd analyst repeats ACE (6 above)
- GYRO marking of features - subjective qualitative assessment of uncertainty
    * Green = High confidence
    * Yellow = Medium confidence
    * Red = Low confidence
    * Orange = Annotations *after* viewing known print
    
## ICFIS Workshop, Trace Evidence

Q: What is trace evidence? 

A: Microscopic debris easily transferred from one location to another

- "We will attempt to physically match anything"
- Paint, tape, glass, fiber, etc. 
- Flowchart of analysis:

## ICFIS Workshop, DNA

- PCR-STR: polymerase chain reaction short tandem repeats
- Replicate a DNA sample, count occurrences of STR alleles at 23 loci
- One mismatched loci is enough to eliminate (in single-source sample)
- Markers for sex are DYS391, Chromosomes (X,Y), one other location
- SE33 is a very discriminating location. [more info here](http://strbase.nist.gov/)
- At most 2 values per location - one from mom, one from dad.
