# Sample Slide

- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

# Fall semester plans: 
 - Shoes
    + Wrap up shoe analysis using edges and SURF 
    + Compare the performance with other methods such as phase only correlations, Fourier-Mellin transformation correlation
    + Do analysis with CSAFE shoe data
    + Submit papers regarding shoe analysis soon!
   
- Research on "uncertainty pyramid" with Steve and Hari at NIST   
 - Glass analysis with Sam
    + Exploratory analysis 
    + Various covariance estimations
    + Submit papers!
   
- Working on book chapters of glass and shoes funded by ROpenSci Fellowship

# Analysis with CSAFE shoe data 
- POC is rotation variant!
- Try to find ways to adjust rotation bewteen two images

class: primary
# Glass Analysis  
- Comparison between Standard method vs. Random forest 
- When two methods disgree,

|   | False neg.  | False pos.| True neg.  | True  pos.  |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|std| 92  |7635   |2299   |9   |
|RF | 9  |2299   |  7635 |92   |

- For false positives, std uses K (27.81%), Li (18.62%), Zr (14.43%), Ba (8.98%), Ti (6.72%)

    -  &lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="black"&gt;Hoping this will help with model performance.&lt;/font&gt;    
    
- Hierarchical model &lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="red"&gt;evaluation&lt;/font&gt;
    -  &lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="red"&gt;Coding: ROC/AUC&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="black"&gt;(multi-class extensions, one vs. all)&lt;/font&gt;
    -  &lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="red"&gt;Coding: ABC for model selection &lt;/font&gt;
    -  &lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="black"&gt;Fscore (micro and macro averaging)&lt;/font&gt;
    -  &lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="black"&gt;Log-loss for multi-class classification&lt;/font&gt;

# Last week

Went to the Committee on National Statistics offices and 137th meetings. 

What I learned: 
  - Turns out there's more to federal statistics than the Census Bureau! 
  - Current administration's talk of reorganizing the federal statistical agencies is causing [uproar](http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2018/08/01/usdafoot/) in the community
  - Bureau of Transportation Statistics has an Office of Spatial Analysis and Visualization
  - The government has A LOT of data out there. Just have to know where to look! (e.g. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) API is the source of gasbuddy.com)
    
Inspired to give a talk to Graphics group on Nov. 16th @ 2:10pm about the many data sources available from the US federal government.
