# Sample Slide

- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

# Groove ID
- Version 2 of changepoint algorithm running (hopefully bug free)
    - Preliminary results seem a little too variable
- Running algorithm on entire Hamby44 set today
- Next step is to gather all of the code in an R package and thoroughly document everything.

class: primary

# SLR
- Looking into "mutual information" between the distribution of the data given a score vs the unconditional distribution of the data to measure information loss 
    - Can potentially estimate this numerically
    
- Putting a prior on $H_0$ vs $H_A$ results in an interesting(?) equality
    - $\log(LR) - \log(SLR) = \frac{1}{p(H_A | X,S)} \left[KL(p(M|X,S) || p(M|S)) - \log(\frac{p(H_0|X,S)}{p(H_0|S)}) \right]$
    - Is it possible to compute a reasonable upper bound for this, specific to the score distribution of interest? 
    - What does it mean that the left side is independent of prior, but right side is not?

# Bullets

- Hamby 44 analysis - compare Hamby 36 to Hamby 44
    - ~~Hopefully will be finished later today~~     
    Finished last Monday. Results are a little weird, but not too bad.
- Resampling with `bulletsamplr` package:     
Use time-series bootstrap methods that ensure continuity (threshold bootstrap) to build a bullet signature using pieces of previously generated signatures
    - Did this week: Got a database of cycles populated with Hamby 36 and Hamby 44 signatures
    - Short term goal: Get the methods working
    - Long term goal: Calculate truly "random" match score statistics to get null distributions

# Image Alignment

- `ShoeAlignR` package renamed to `ImageAlignR` 
    - useful for fingerprints as well
    <!-- - algorithms aren't working with color images yet... not sure why -->
- Implemented an alignment algorithm from a [Kaggle post](https://www.kaggle.com/vicensgaitan/image-registration-the-r-way/notebook)
    - Harris Corner detection + KNN features + RANSAC to find a matching transformation for alignment
    - Added SURF feature detector from `image.dlib` package

<img src = "images/susan/ShoeOverlayNikeByCheckin.png" width = "100%"/>
- Red = appears in warped image only
- Blue = appears in unwarped image only
- Black = appears in both images (overlapped points)

# Image Alignment

- Still to do:
    - ~~Need to add a better feature detector - corner detection misses some shoe features~~
    - Figure out whether the algorithm isn't working on certain shoes:
        - Image cleaning?
        - Poor feature detection?
        - Different people wearing the shoes?
            - The algorithm does much better when aligning shoes at the same timepoint (but still isn't perfect)
    - Get the algorithm working on color images
    - Use on fingerprint data

---
class: primary
# Neural Networks

- Add features to shiny app that facilitate debugging/fixing labels
    - Chunk image linked directly to LabelMe page for the shoe
- Automate generation of labeled images (at 5pm daily) and integrate with model script
    - Shrink large regions down instead of slicing them up
    - No more filling in white pixels with the mean pixel value
- New model is fit every night after image generation is done

# Augmentation

- Recent models have had 92-95% accuracy*
    - *Images still improving in quality
    - *Unequal class representation makes "accuracy" not the best measure overall, but is consistent across all previous models so far
- Augmented images rotate, flip, and shear data to prevent over-fitting

# Automation...

- On Friday, Susan and I set up scripts to automatically run a new model each night on most recent images
- Something seemed wrong...
- Turns out, (4\*4\*4\*4)(11,318) = 2,897,408 >> 45,272 = (11,318)\*4
    - Now, the script will check whether data has been augmented already...
