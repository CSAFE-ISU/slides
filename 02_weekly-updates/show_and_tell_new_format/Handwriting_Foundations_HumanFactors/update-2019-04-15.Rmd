What's changed: 

- New person slide: 

````

class: secondary

- New content slide with title: 

````

# Sample Slide

- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

- If you are going to add an image, **create a directory** with your name within "images" folder. For example, "images/**guillermo**/sample_image.JPG"


 <img src = "images/guillermo/sample_image.JPG" width="35%"/>

# Project Summary

- Is it reasonable to replace the true LR with an SLR in court? 
- Gaussian example with known score distribution
- Generalize patterns through probabilistic bounds on the LR
- Examine these bounds and patterns in a more realistic, simulated setting

---
class: primary
# Main Questions

- How large are discrepancies between an LR and an SLR?
- How likely are discrepancies? 
- How meaningful are discrepancies? 
- How likely are meaningful discrepancies? 

---
class: primary
# Main Results

- Change in score $\neq$ change in data $\implies$ large discrepancies possible  
- $P \left(LR < \alpha SLR | S(X,Y) = s, H_d \right) \geq 1 - \frac{1}{\alpha}$
- $P \left(LR > SLR/\alpha | S(X,Y) = s, H_p \right) \geq 1 - \frac{1}{\alpha}$

class: primary
# Other Interesting Results

- $M_1 < LR < M_2 \implies M_1 < SLR < M_2$
- $SLR \ll E_{Y|s,H_p}\left[ LR \right] \implies$ inability to make claims about how small the LR might be if $H_d$ is true
- $SLR^{-1} \ll E_{Y|s,H_d}\left[ LR^{-1} \right] \implies$ inability to make claims about how large the LR might be if $H_p$ is true
