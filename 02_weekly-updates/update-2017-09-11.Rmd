## shinyapps repo

The shinyapps repo on github is a sandbox for our different shiny applications:

bulletr, [x3p-viewer](https://x3p-viewer.shinyapps.io/x3p-viewer/), and groove-finder are on there at the moment.

## Shoeprint 1 by Soyoung
- Created database of 150 pairs of shoe print images with 5 reps on each foot. 
- The algorithm speeds up and is packed as the package 'shoeprintr'.
- Toward a final score for similarity between shoe prints.

## Shoeprint 2 by Soyoung
- Find more evidence of KM and KNM.

## Jason Saporta

I spent the summer at Credit Suisse making models for predicting loan defaults, prepayments, etc. Not much connection with CSAFE unless you believe everybody on Wall St. is a criminal.

During the past week I implemented a neural network for matching bullet signatures. Everything's running well, but no serious results yet.

Plans for this week:
- Maybe actually getting results for the aforementioned model
- Replicating studies on CNN effectiveness for stego problems
- Reading more about recent developments in Bayesian ML and determining if that could help with my research

## Shoeprints App and Package (Guillermo and Martin)

- Upload your images
- Pre-process image (negate values, rotate, crop, etc)
- Algorithm to find affine transformation parameters

## On Shoeprints Profile (Guillermo and Martin)

## Regarding Shoeprints Database (Guillermo and Martin)

- A lot of this is going on. Among them
   - Matscan (feet pressure heatmap)
   - 3D scanner (fixed)
   - 3D scanner (handheld)
   - High resolution camera
   - Shoeprints on sand
   - Stand on paper (detailed, walking, stomping, twisting and more than one print)
