# Show and Tell <br> September 25

# Soyoung's Slides

## Soyoung's slides 1
- Working on experiments for possible attributes for similarity score
- Known Match (KM) : 20 comparisons
- Known Non-Match (KNM) : 25 comparisons

- Average of overlap features from KM and KNM

## Soyoung's slides 3
- Standard deviation of rotation angle estimation from KM and KNM

# Martin's Slides

## Update on Image Alignment
- Now its possible to align two shoeprints after selecting three matching points on each image
- Even when the transformation its done in C++, it is still a bit slow when working on the full resolution (roughly 4000x2000 pixels). Working on parallelization

## Example

<tr>
<td> <img src="images/img1_show.png" width=190> </td>
<td> <img src="images/img2_show.png" width=190> </td>
<td> <img src="images/imgt_show.png" width=190> </td>
</tr>

## 
- We need to transform all the shoeprints to the same scale, to be able to talk about the same cross section for any given shoeprint
- The Israeli Police on a report from 2016 describes an approach to deal with this problem

<tr>

<td> <img src="images/israeli_2.png" width=400> </td>
</tr>

## 
- We have the tools to do this manually, but it does not seem hard to do it automatically (at least for the nice images from the EverOS)
- Procedure to test this week:
    + Find the dominant direction of the shoeprint (three ideas to try: Radon transformation, linear regression and principal components)
    + Find the center of the shoeprint using the sample mean of the non-zero pixels coordinates
    + Search for the first and last non-zero pixel across the found axis
