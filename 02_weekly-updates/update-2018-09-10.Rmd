# Sample Slide

- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

- If you are going to add an image, **create a directory** with your name within "images" folder. For example, "images/**guillermo**/sample_image.JPG"


 <img src = "images/guillermo/sample_image.JPG" width="35%"/>

# UI Development

- Fixed click events for Layered Graphics display in Shiny using some sample datasets.
- Discovered after lots of pain that some shiny render events, by default, delete all the files in use!!

- Implementing the framework for a small sample bullet dataset
- Overview of the app layout
  - First Layer: bullet-to-bullet comparisons, Second Layer: land-to-land comparisons, then Visual comparisons of images, signatures, and so on.

# Bullets

- Hamby 36 analysis
    - Use `bulletxtrctr` with legacy featurees
    - Intelligent re-calculation of results - only recalculate if the inputs have changed
    - smarter parallel processing - memory issues
- Hamby 44 analysis
    - Goal is to compare Hamby 36 to Hamby 44

# Shoes

- Image alignment/shoe coordinate system algorithm
    - [`ShoeAlignR` package](https://github.com/srvanderplas/ShoeAlignR)
    - Still to do: See how consistent the coordinates are from image to image (same shoe)
    - May also apply to chemistry/fingerprint image alignment

# Shoes

- Shoe NN Images:
    - Better labeling - quality control
    - Add "context" - for non-rectangular polygons, use minimum bounding rectangle
        - less distortion
        - ensures NN isn't recognizing cutout shape instead of actual image features
    - Fill in white pixels with median non-white pixel value - lower background contrast
