## User test

Three operators A, C, M were asked to scan two bullets each (from the same barrel) - i.e. the two bullets match each other

... look at the results ...

## What happened?

- bullet-to-bullet scores 
- high rf score is indicative of a match

## Axis for a Shoeprint found with Linear Regression

## Update on the Shoeprints Alignment

- Using linear regression to find the axis of a shoeprint does a good job, but far from what wee need
- After searching for methods to align binary images, it seems there is not that much done for this as special case
- A bunch of people claim that the "imregister" function from MATLAB does a very good job even for binary images
- The more important thing for "imregister" is that the objects on both images are not very far apart
