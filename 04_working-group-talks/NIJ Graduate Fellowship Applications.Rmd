# Application Process  

## Description of Solicitation  

**Title**:  Graduate Research Fellowship in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics  

- Work must have demonstrable implications for addressing the implications of preventing or controlling crime, and/or the fair and impartial administration of criminal justice in the U.S.  
- Areas of interest:  
    - Reducing crime (particularly violent) 
    - Protecting police officers and other peeps 
    - Issues concerning the opioid abuse epidemic 
    - Victimization (human trafficking) 
    - "Supporting prosecutors in their efforts to meet their mission"
    - Illegal immigration issues  
- Those considering forensic evidence research should look at:  
    - OSAC Research Needs 
    - NIJ Technology Working Group list of research areas  
    - NIJ Core Science and Technology Research Objectives  


## Why we were chosen to apply (student status)  

- Up to 3 years of funding for a dissertation  
- Eligibility: Enrolled in a doctoral STEM program, proposal of dissertation that is relevant  
- Why us?  
    - Literally, WHY US?  
- Early in the process of dissertation research  
    - Doesn't help to apply if you're almost done  
    - All had a vague idea of a dissertation that seemed to fit the solicitation  



## How Amy's research fits in  

**Title**: Handwriting and stuff 


## How Nate's research fits in  

**Title**:  Spatio-temporal point processes for crime (STOPPR)  

- Crime modeling and prediction
- Bayesian spatio-temporal point process models 
- Provide a framework and hopefully a tool for others (criminologists, law enforcement) to make predictions or test hypotheses  

## How Kiegan's research fits in  

**Title**:  Strengthening foundational validity of 3D imaging in bullet examinations: persistence and variability of scans  

- Secondary Analysis of Striation Persistence Data  
- High-Resolution Microscopy Variability Study 
- Comparison of several currently proposed methods for analysis  
- Adding more information to the world of 3D bullet imaging 
- Testing out sensitivity of methods on new/different data!  


## The Process  
- Many documents that needed to be prepared:  
    - Budget detail / narrative (Marc and Stacy prepared these)
    - Conflict of interest form (template)
    - Project Abstract (400 words)
    - Statement of Support from Committee Chair (thanks everyone!)  
    - Undergraduate Transcripts (WHY...?)
    - Graduate Transcripts
    - Enrollment Verification  
    - **Research Narrative AND APPENDICES** 
        - Bibliography/References (supposed to be fairly comprehensive)  
        - Curriculum Vitae/Resumes (of student and advisors)  
        - Personal Statement (2 pages, including career goals)
        - List of dissertation committee (template)
        - Proposed timeline/milestones (we honestly have no idea)
        - Privacy Certificate (weird form)
        - Letters of Cooperation from outside collaborators (Thanks Gary and Vic!)  

 
## Research Narrative   
- Structure:  
    - 12 pages max (minus title page, contents)
    - Title page (surprisingly complicated) 
    - Table of contents (easy enough)
    - Statement of Problem and Research Questions  
    - Project Design and Implementation  
    - Capabilities and Competencies  
- Things to remember:  
    - Research need in area of study 
    - Current gaps in data, research, and knowledge  
    - Discuss previous research relevant to the problem 
    - Data acquisition methods (in detail)
    - Demonstrate validity and relevance of data to be collected  
    - Justify methods of data analysis 
    - Address feasibility and speculate potential challenges, plans to mitigate them  
    - Plans to make results available to interested parties 
    - Capabilities of the student and the advisor
    - Academic environment and supporting resources 
    - Project management plan  
    

## Pros of the Process
Pros  

- We had a lot of help!! (Thanks Stacy, Sarah, Marc, and Harlie!)
- Forced us to form a research plan  
    - What the research questions are  
    - How we are going to address the questions we have  
- Gave us each a semi?-comprehensive lit review (base for going forward)  
- Now we all have these materials ready to work off of moving forward  
- Know what the process looks like  
- Would be really good for CSAFE as an organization  
    - Expanding on current research 
    - Adding a cool new type of research to the pot  
    

## Cons of the Process  
Cons  

- HUGE amount of time and energy - developing research narrative
- HUGE amount of time and energy - all the appendices/documents  
    - Big organizational challenge  
    - Large group of people involved - gets messy!
- Short notice  
- Lack of familiarity with the process  
  
  
# Outline of Research Narratives  

## Kiegan: Bullet Data  

How did I decide on my research questions?  
- Have been working with bullet data  
- Automated methods for groove identification in 3D bullet land scans
