# Sample Slide

- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

    * Another thesis chapter to JCGS. (No word yet on other paper submitted to ISR)
    * Glass EDA paper (w/Soyoung) to JFS 
    * Jury study paper (from a while ago...) to LPR
- Other research 
    * Covariance matrices for glass element concentrations (w/SP)
    * Keep researching uncertainty pyramid related things (w/SP, SL, HI)
    * ROpenSci fellowship book. Current plan: release in April
- Reading/working group 
    * Reading the [paper](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v028i05) introducing the `caret` package.  
    * Applying principles from applied machine learning [workshop](https://github.com/topepo/rstudio-conf-2019) at rstudio::conf (I wrote a blog post about my experience at rstudio::conf [here](https://sctyner.github.io/rstudio-conf.html).)

# Vest prints
- Variations : 6 weights & 5 pairs of shoes (ID) & 2 sides of shoes (Left and Right) & 5 repeated impressions for each side 

  * KM : repeated measurements within a shoe ID 
  * KNM 1 : Fix weight - between shoe IDs
  * KNM 2 : Fix shoe 01 - between six weights
  * KNM 2-ID5 : Fix shoe ID 05 - between six weights
  * KNM 3 : shoe ID 1 vs shoe ID 2:5 on six weights
