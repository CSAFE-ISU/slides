- If you are going to add an image, **create a directory** with your name within "images" folder. For example, "images/**guillermo**/sample_image.JPG"

 <img src = "images/guillermo/sample_image.JPG" width="35%"/>

.right-column[
- Processing annotated images in R (greater control)
- Adding multi-class labels to use for one-hot encoding
- Adding attributes (rounded, elongated) and textures as labels
- Resizing images to 256x256
- Splitting up images that are more than 384x384 into multiple images with the same labels

# `bulletxtrctr`

- Writing tests for the new processing sub-package of what is now `bulletr`
    - Structure of output (e.g. function returns a data frame with the right number of columns)
    - Numerical correctness of output (function returns the "correct" result when given the same input)
- Goal: Make it easier to detect downstream effects of small changes to parameters in the processing algorithms

# Data Collection (Shoes): Part 1 

* All Data collection -> compleated
* 19,200 files (Before replicates)
* Working with IT: Archiver 
* Under 100 errors
* Manual on procedures and subsaquent changes -> Done

---
class: primary
# Data Collection (Shoes): Part 2

* Continue with a subset of the 160 shoes
* Realistic Shoe outsole impressions
* Prints will be lifted/cast using realistic methods
   + Some older methods may carry over to this collection (ie. 3D scanning, 2D scanning)
* Currently in the development stage

# SLRs

- "Lack of Confidence in ABC Model Choice" (Robert et al. 2011)
    - Not always a relationship between an LR and an SLR. 
    - Not obvious that same issues will arise in the forensic context
- What is the worst case scenario for an SLR under some mild assumptions (i.e. model identifiability, finite second moments)?
    - Information loss based on insufficient statistic is maximized when the data distribution has maximum entropy (?)
    - With finite second moments I *think* this means the data are independent Normal. 
    - Given a mean and variance, we could get a distribution for the difference in the log(LR) - log(SLR) (or log(SLR) - log(LR))

# Project proposal

Training videos:

- online 
- different audiences
- different lengths (short v. longer)
- ideas welcome! 

Some ideas are: 

- likelihood ratio explainer
- role of statistics in forensic science
- automatic bullet matching with bulletr

# REUs 

- All done with the database creation!! 
- Now lives on csafe server (las/research/csafe) in the handwritten-letters-db folder
- one csv with all in one (letterdatabase.csv)
- one csv per document (letters_document_x.csv) where x is a document ID in the CVL database
- 7 authors per document
- Structured similarly to the MNIST data: 28 x 28 pixel grayscale images. 

e.g. Imagine:
