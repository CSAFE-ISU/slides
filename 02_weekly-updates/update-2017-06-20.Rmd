# Show and Tell <br> June 20

## Grooves 
- Check multiple spots on the land to see where the get_grooves_rollapply function is failing.

## Grooves 
- These images are HUGE, so we will be downsampling the full land to save some of that space.  
- Every 3rd x value will be kept  
- If anyone has better suggestions for downsampling, please let us know!  

## Grooves - now implementing  
- Median instead of mean  
- Single smoothing instead of double smoothing  
- Testing different smoothing parameters - is it smoothing enough of the striations out?  
- Still calculate edge values in smoothing that were previously cut off due to the smoothing window.  
- These will each go in as a 'method' in forked `bulletr`, and updated with changes if any are promising.  
- For each land we test, all of these methods will be plotted side-by-side.
