# Groove ID 

* Two-class classification using LASSO
* Things to consider: 
    * Very unbalanced response
    * May consider adding additional features
    * Training/test sets: keep bullets grouped together? 
    * May add a random component for bullet

class: primary
# Groove ID  

* Going to work on metadata sheet for notes on bullets Nate and I work with 
* Update `grooves` GitHub so it actually has some information about our project 
* Clean up!

## bulletxtrctr

* rewriting tests to work with `covr` test coverage package
* Use setup.R and teardown.R files to set up data for tests and clean up the environment afterwards
* Only compare results from current algorithm to results from previous versions of the algorithm on Bigfoot (not on CRAN or Travis)
* This week: tests for the separate features functions

# Truthiness

* Separate image files (outside of the Rmd files) for each of 11 image types x 12 claims
    * consistent size, style (as much as map aspect ratio issues allow)
    * minimize the number of packages required
* This week: shiny app to present the survey - too complicated to do with Qualtrics
