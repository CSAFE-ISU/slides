# Nate 

## SLR's

- Trying to understand what goes into the construction of an SLR
    - Choosing relevant populations under the prosecution and defense hypotheses
        - Different "anchorings" can result in very different SLR's (Hepler et al. 2012)
    - Choosing score function
        - Including measure of typicality of the unknown source in the score function itself may be necessary (Morrison and Enzinger 2018)
    - Choosing how to model score distributions
        - Well-known tail problems

## SLR's (cont.)
- Questions
    - What choices are amenable to general guidelines/rules? 
    - How can we make SLR's behave more similarly to LR's or to each other?
    - Do the above choices depend on each other? For example, could differences in SLR's be ameliorated by incorporating measures of typicality?
