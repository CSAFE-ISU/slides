## Sample Table with Equations

For me (Guillermo), it's been a nightmare to type equations and tables in RMarkdowns. But you can try...

| Column A  | Column B  |
| :- | :- |
| 1 | 2 |
| $\pi^e$ | $e^\pi$ |
| $1/2$ | $\sum_{j=1} a_j$ |
| $1/2$ | $\frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{2^3} + \frac{1}{2^4} + \cdots$ |
