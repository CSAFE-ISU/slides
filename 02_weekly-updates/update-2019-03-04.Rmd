# Sample Slide

- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

# Tonight

### Crime Solving with Genetic Genealogy
#### CeCe Moore
##### 8:00 pm – Sun Room, Memorial Union

Abstract: *The 2018 arrest of the Golden State serial killer in California made international headlines in part because police teamed up with genealogists to use familial DNA to track him down. This new method of sleuthing raises questions about how it’s done, ethics and privacy, and the reliability of genetic and DNA tests. CeCe Moore is an investigative genetic genealogist and media consultant. She has worked as the genetic genealogist for the PBS Television documentary series Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates, Jr. since 2013. She is the founder of The DNA Detectives and recently joined forces with Parabon Nanolabs to lead their new Genetic Genealogy Services for law enforcement unit. National Affairs Series: Building a Better Democracy.*

# Last Week

- NIJ grant: Class Characteristics
    - Call with Lesley Hammer - ways to frame the data collection to solve problems examiners currently face
    - Email to DCI Investigator - will follow up this week

- Bullet software
    - updated tests for `x3ptools`
    - tried to fix Travis for `x3ptools` (fixed!) and `bulletxtrctr` (not fixed)
