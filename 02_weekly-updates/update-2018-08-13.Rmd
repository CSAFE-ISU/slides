# A paper I read 

Bay H., Tuytelaars T., Van Gool L. (2006) SURF: Speeded Up Robust Features. In: Leonardis A., Bischof H., Pinz A. (eds) Computer Vision â€“ ECCV 2006. ECCV 2006. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 3951. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg

https://doi.org/10.1007/11744023_32

Next week (beginning of semester), we will set some group guidelines for the Show and Tell meetings. With the summer ending: 

1. More people will be attending the show and tells
2. More will be happening. 

So, we want to make sure our meetings are efficient and productive. Start thinking about what the optimal show and tell looks like. We will make "rules" together as a group in our first meeting of the semester. (Look for a whenisgood from Guillermo)
