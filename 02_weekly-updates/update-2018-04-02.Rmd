## package `x3ptools`

- sorry I can't be here in person ... surprising soccer duty
- package `x3ptools` allows us to work with x3p files (topographic measurements in 3d):
read, write, visualize, rotate, sample, interpolate, ...
- see https://heike.github.io/x3ptools/
- the package is very close to be on CRAN
- we can successfully write x3p files for NIST

## Progress on uploading files to NIST

- for bullet lands NIST wants to have files smaller than 5 MB
- at 20x magnification we are at 5.5 MB in x3p format
- therefore we down sample to a resolution of 1.29 microns per pixel
- next step: upload files to NIST
- problem: upload is one land at a time 

## Progress on DFSC

- protocol for individual cartridge case capture complete
- protocol for automated multi-cartridge case capture in the testing phase
- first set of cartridge cases scanned 
- using private git LFS (large file storage) repository to (a) keep track of file versions and (b) exchange files with CMU
