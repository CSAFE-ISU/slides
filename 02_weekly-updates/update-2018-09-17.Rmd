- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

- If you are going to add an image, **create a directory** with your name within "images" folder. For example, "images/**guillermo**/sample_image.JPG"


 <img src = "images/guillermo/sample_image.JPG" width="35%"/>

- Hamby clone set 224 <span style="color:orange">scans done </span>

- Hamby set 224 <span style="color:orange">scans done </span>

- <span style="color:orange">Hamby set 10 arrived from St Louis, in scanning process. </span>

# Hamby 224 - Clone

- Hamby 224 Clone

    - organized as test set: two known bullets from the same barrel are paired with an unknown
    
    - total of fifteen test sets (one for each unknown): some clones have replicates
