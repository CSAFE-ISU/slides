class: primary
# Bullet projects - Big picture 

- **data collection**

- **computational tools**

- matching lands: 

    1. crosscut identification
    2. **groove location**
    3. curvature removal
    4. alignment of signatures
    5. feature extraction
    6. matching with **trained Random Forest**

- **analysis of results**

- **communication of results**

class: primary
# Update from the data collection

- **scans from bullet lands (about 20,000 total)**

    - **LAPD: 4 bullets per barrel for 526 out of 626 firearms**
    - **Variability study: ~2000 scans**
    - Hamby Sets 10, 36, 44, 224, and a clone (35 bullets each)
    - Houston test sets (6 kits with 25 bullets each)
    - Houston persistence: 8 barrels with 40 fired bullets each
    - St Louis persistence: 2 barrels with 192 fired bullets each
    - most of the CSAFE persistence study 
    
- **and cartridge cases**

    - DFSC (about 2000)
    - getting ready to scan cartridges for CSAFE persistence
    
- **shooting range**
    
    - **we were out on the range last week: barrels #4 to #7 (in record time!)**
    - **we are planning to go out to the range one more time to finish up the persistence study**

# Groove identification

Two papers in preparation:  

- (Kiegan) Journal of Forensic Sciences paper on initial groove ID methods  
    - Getting into right format, submitting today or tomorrow!  
    
- (Kiegan and Nate) FSI Paper on advanced groove ID methods
    - Two-Class Classification Method
    - Bayesian Changepoint Method (Nate)
    - Pairwise results comparison on 3 bullet test sets   
    - Cleaning up, getting ready for submission  
    
- Future Work: Hough Transformation (Charlotte)

# Hough Transforms

- A computer-vision algorithm that detects aligned points in an image
- Two points appear on the same line in an image will have intersecting lines in the feature space.
- Strong edges will have a lot of points along it, therefore a lot of intersections at that specific point.

# Current status

- Hough groove method is currently a part of bulletxtrctr and grooveFinder

- Changing the `get_grooves_hough` function to now return two functions that calculate the index of each left and right groove location based on the height at which a cross cut is taken


&lt;img src = "heike/groove-comparisons.png" width = 90% height = 60%/&gt;


---
class: primary
# Next steps:

  - Exploring Hough transform options when grooves are excluded
  
  - Also trying to write up some of this work in a coherent manner
  
  - fine-tuning of parameters, comparison with other methods

# Computational tools

- **fix3p**:  Chrome extension by Talen Fisher (updated)

- **x3ptools**

- **grooveFinder**

    - implementation of various techniques to identify groove locations
    - github: [heike/grooveFinder](https://heike.github.io/grooveFinder/)
    
    - pull request to `imager` to remove plyr dependency (Susan) - merged yesterday!

# Project Updates: VARIABILITY STUDY  

Goal of automated methods is to reduce human involvement in decision making.  

Some things need to be quantified about the automated bullet matching process:  
- Potential impact of different humans scanning LEAs 
- Potential impact of different machines 
- Whether differences impact raw data, processed data
- Whether differences impact matching scores


---
class: primary   
# Project Updates: VARIABILITY STUDY  

Data collection COMPLETE!!!!  
- 9 bullets 
    - 3 bullets each from 3 barrels
    - Hamby, Houston, CSAFE Persistence  
- 5 operators
- 2 machines
- 3-5 repetitions per operator/machine  
- ~ 2000 scans to work with.

# Project Updates  

What's up next?  
- Priority is *publishing*!!  
- Standard bullet scans  
- Thinking about framework for R&amp;R, quality metrics   
   - Package, shiny application, etc...  
- Working on the book

# REU projects

Better, but ...

---
class: primary
# Scan quality assessment

- extract features from scan to determine quality:

    - Number/percentage of missing values
    - location of missing values along horizontal axis

- find good cut-offs based on marginal distribution of features

- build warning system for immediate feedback


---
class: primary
# Random forest re-factoring

- exact feature definition/calculation changed in move from bulletr to bulletxtrctr

- re-run algorithms on Hamby 252 and 173 (NIST scans) 

- compare results from old run to new run

- re-fit Random forest to Hamby 252 and 173, compare scores

- re-fit Random forest on higher-resolution scans

# User Interfaces #1

*User Interface for the batching transformations on land images, striation extraction and batching*
  - Data generation, Initial Diagnostics for visualization
  - Process involves
    - View a sample bullet land
    - Identify the problems in scaling, transformations, or anyother issues
    - Select all bullet folders with corresponding lands that you seek to compare
    - Rectify or make changes to the sample, Batch operation
