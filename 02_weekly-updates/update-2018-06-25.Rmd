- If you are going to add an image, **create a directory** with your name within "images" folder. For example, "images/**guillermo**/sample_image.JPG"

 <img src = "images/guillermo/sample_image.JPG" width="35%"/>

# SLRs

- Reading about ABC to be able to understand the papers Chris recommended to me. 
- Assuming no mistakes, $e^{E[log(SLR)|H_0]} \leq E\left[\frac{SLR}{LR} | H_0 \right]$.
    - left side is computable
    - right side is some measure of the average quality of the LR under $H_0$ 
    - still not that useful for bounding probabilities

$$
\begin{aligned}
E\left[\frac{SLR}{LR}|H_0\right] &= e^{log\left( E\left[\frac{SLR}{LR} | H_0 \right] \right)} \\
& \geq e^{E\left[ log\left(\frac{SLR}{LR} \right) |H_0 \right]} \\
& = e^{E\left[ log(SLR) |H_0 \right] - E\left[ log(LR) |H_0 \right]} \\
& \geq e^{E\left[ log(SLR) |H_0 \right] - log\left(E\left[ LR |H_0 \right] \right)} \\
& = e^{E\left[ log(SLR) |H_0 \right]}
\end{aligned}

# Groove ID

- Reading about changepoint detection
- Possible approach similar to some examples given in "Bayesian Retrospective Multiple-Changepoint Identification" (Stephens 1994) in JRSSc. 
    - Doesn't seem fundamentally tied to time series data
