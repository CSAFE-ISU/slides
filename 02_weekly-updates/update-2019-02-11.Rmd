- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

# Spring Goals

- Submit, submit, submit! 
    * Another thesis chapter to JCGS.
    * Glass EDA paper (w/SP) to JFS (submit by end of Feb. complete draft by end of this week.)
    * Jury study paper to LPR
- Other research 
    * Covariance matrices for glass element concentrations
    * Keep researching uncertainty pyramid related things
    * ROpenSci fellowship book. To be released in April
- Reading/working group sessions 
    * February 13th: Presenting the process of fitting a random forest to the glass data, following the [`tidymodels`](https://github.com/tidymodels) workflow & principles. 
    * February 20th: Working meeting applying the `tidymodels` principles to your own data. This could be CSAFE or other data for your research. Or, pick a dataset from the wild (try the [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) repo). Reference materials: code from the Applied ML [workshop](https://github.com/topepo/rstudio-conf-2019) at rstudio::conf

# Exciting news! 

- Have an interview for a [AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellowship](https://www.aaas.org/programs/science-technology-policy-fellowships)
- Have to write a **briefing memo** on a topic of our choice (my choice: open data & public access to data) by this Thursday at 7am, so I'll be a bit distracted until Thursday. :) 

![Footage of me working on the memo this weekend](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q5j3jizOL60/VV52DuTGcaI/AAAAAAAAIUQ/ZGG6FzWp0pw/s1600/tmhnks.gif)
