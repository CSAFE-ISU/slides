## Bullet Matching Models

- Changing the classification score cutoff drastically changes confusion matrices and model performance.
- Ideal cutoff for current random forest model seems to be somewhere around 0.85.
- Arguably better results with a simple neural network model (MLP with 5 hidden layers, no regularization).
