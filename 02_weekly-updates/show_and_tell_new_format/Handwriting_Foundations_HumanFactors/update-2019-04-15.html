# Project Summary

- Is it reasonable to replace the true LR with an SLR in court? 
- Gaussian example with known score distribution
- Generalize patterns through probabilistic bounds on the LR
- Examine these bounds and patterns in a more realistic, simulated setting

---
class: primary
# Main Questions

- How large are discrepancies between an LR and an SLR?
- How likely are discrepancies? 
- How meaningful are discrepancies? 
- How likely are meaningful discrepancies? 

---
class: primary
# Main Results

- Change in score `\(\neq\)` change in data `\(\implies\)` large discrepancies possible  
- `\(P \left(LR &lt; \alpha SLR | S(X,Y) = s, H_d \right) \geq 1 - \frac{1}{\alpha}\)`
- `\(P \left(LR &gt; SLR/\alpha | S(X,Y) = s, H_p \right) \geq 1 - \frac{1}{\alpha}\)`

---
class: primary
# Other Interesting Results

- `\(M_1 &lt; LR &lt; M_2 \implies M_1 &lt; SLR &lt; M_2\)`
- `\(SLR \ll E_{Y|s,H_p}\left[ LR \right] \implies\)` inability to make claims about how small the LR might be if `\(H_d\)` is true
- `\(SLR^{-1} \ll E_{Y|s,H_d}\left[ LR^{-1} \right] \implies\)` inability to make claims about how large the LR might be if `\(H_p\)` is true

# Update on NIJ Handwriting Project

- Overall goal: To see whether the kinematic similarities/differences can explain examiner responses
- Sent out a survey containing 40 pairs of writing
    - 20 pairs contained cursive writing
    - 20 pairs contained print writing
    - 10 pairs were known same writer comparisons
    - 30 pairs were known different writer comparisons
- Received responses from 41 FDE
    - Responses are ordinal: 1-7
    - Modified the 9-pt scale by removing identification and exclusion extremes
    - 1 indicates extrememly weak support for the hypothesis
    - 7 indicated extremely strong support for hypothesis

# Update on NIJ Handwriting Project

- Problem: The initial exploratory data analysis revealed that on average, examiners were doing terribly in determining whether the pairs came from the same writer or from different writers
    - Examiners tended to give low support to the prosecution hypothesis for known same writer comparisons
    - Examiners tended to give low support to the defense hypothesis for known different writer comparisons
- Solution: Found out that SurveyMonkey flipped all the scores
    - 7 (extremely strong support) appeared 1st so SurveyMonkey assigned it a score of 1
    - 1 (extremely weak support) appeared 7th so SurveyMonkey assigned it a score of 7

# Update on NIJ Handwriting Project

- Each comparison in the survey has 2 sets of kinematics
    - 1 for the first document in the comparison
    - 1 for the second documents in the comparions
    - each document is split into upstrokes and downstrokes
- Each stroke has 4 types of features
    - Temporal: Stroke Duration, Peak Vertical Velcity, Average Vertical Velocity
    - Spatial/Geometric: Vertical Size, Horizontal Size, Absolute Size, Slant, Loop Surface, Roadlength
    - Fluency: Number of Peak Acceleration Points
    - Pressure: Average Pen Pressure

class: primary   
# Update on NIJ Handwriting Project

- Problem: each document has A LOT of kinematic measurements
- Problem: stroke 1 of document 1 doesn't necessarily correspond to stroke 1 of document 2
- Need to find a way to combine kinematic features to get scores for a single document
    - For each feature set, used a Wasserstein distance (comparison of empirical CDFs) to get 2 scores for each comparison
    - 1 score for upstrokes, 1 score for downstrokes
    - Results in 8 total scores for a single comparison
    - Low scores indicate similar kinematics

class: primary   
# Update on NIJ Handwriting Project

- With the kinematic scores worked out, I proceeded to model the examiner responses (correctly reversed) using the 8 scores as predictors via ordinal logistic regression ... and found nothing!
- Problem: There were a subset of examiners who gave the same score to the prosecution hypothesis that they did to the defense hypothesis
- Solution: Developed a "coherency" score
    - If an examiner was truly using a coherent LR-approach, then whatever score they gave for the prosecution hypothesis would be the reverse of whatever score they gave the defense hypothesis
    - Example: A coherent examiner who said 6 for Hp would say 2 for Hd
    - Example: A coherent examiner who said 3 for Hp would say 5 for Hd
    - Result: some examiners are doing a coherent LR-style method, while others are presumably doing a Two-Stage approach!
