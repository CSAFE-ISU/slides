- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

# Self care ideas

Because the world can get us all down sometimes and we forget to care for ourselves:

- meditate
- go to yoga
- take a nap
- drink water 
- take a bath
- go on a walk 
- go to bed early
- drink herbal tea
- read your favorite book 
- call a friend you haven't talked to in a while
- watch cat fail videos on YouTube
