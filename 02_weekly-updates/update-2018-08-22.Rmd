# This Summer

- Processing and cleaning Shoeprints Database
  + Vinyl pictures: Modified Python program to rename them and created R program to check that name is correct.
  + MatScan files: wrote AutoIt script to automatically extract files and made R program to name them accordingly (plus I wrote some programs to generate our own images and GIFs that will not be included in the database).
  
- Make changes to IRB (and there are still some pending changes)

- Registration of 3D scans of shoeprints
