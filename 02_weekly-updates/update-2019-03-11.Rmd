# Sample Slide

- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

# Last Week

- NIJ Grant Proposal
    - Prototype machine will be ready after Spring Break  - "land mine actuated camera"
    
    - Series of emails with SoleMate about possibility of creating an API, but they don't have the resources right now.
    
    - Reframing proposal in terms of immediate utility to practitioners    
    <div class="small">Iowa DCI doesn't use SoleMate - if they examine a shoe, it's because they've already recovered a suspect's physical shoe. They aren't looking to see what shoes could have made any given print.</div>
    
- `x3ptools` - update testing for add_grid_x3p. Test coverage is back at 98% (or was when I wrote this)
