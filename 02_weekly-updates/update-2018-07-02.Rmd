- If you are going to add an image, **create a directory** with your name within "images" folder. For example, "images/**guillermo**/sample_image.JPG"

 <img src = "images/guillermo/sample_image.JPG" width="35%"/>

# Longitudinal Data Collection
* Done reviewing existing files:

   + 2D
   + 3D
   + Paper
   + Film
   + Photos

* Still have a high error report: 

   + Mat Scanner 
   + Vinyl Photos

# This Week
## Moving Forward

* This week: 
   + Re-name vinyl crime scene photos 
   + take care of missing files.

# Automating Bullet Data Uploads

- RSelenium package to remote-control a browser
- select links and input fields using CSS/Xpath
- Create barrels first, then add bullets, then add land scans to each bullet

# Groove Identification

- Time last week spent getting a feel for the bullet data
- Thinking about modeling the residuals from robust loess using piecewise Gaussian processes
    - major computational issues to this approach
        - demands modification to approach taken in the JRSSc paper 
        - I think there are a couple of reasonable remedies for this issue, but I've heard of more in the literature.
    - Going to try a proof of concept on bullet data with sampled subsets of residuals.

# Neural Networks
- Preliminary models to classify triangles vs. circles
    - Modified from cat vs. dog examples in "Deep Learning with R"
    - ~ 500 images in each class, plus augmentation 
        -50% training, 25% validation, 25% test

# Expected fitting accuracy
- Training a convnet from scratch (1st example from book)
- Expected about 70% accuracy on test set

# Unexpected results
- After training classifier on pre-trained VGG16 base, ran fine-tuning step
- Should have increased accuracy from 90% to 96%
- In reality, test set accuracy was ~40%
