# Sample Slide

- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

# Fall Semester Goals

- `x3ptools` and `bulletxtrctr`
    - \&gt; 95% test coverage (if possible)
    - Results database - data provenance
    - Docker or packrat to ensure environment reproducibility
- Truthiness study data collection
- Paper with Miranda (Creative Component):    
one-hot Convolutional NN for shoeprint feature recognition
- Longitudinal Shoeprint Database
    - Functioning well enough to present at AAFS in Feb

class: primary
# Neural Networks

- Model fixed!
    - After implementing aumentation, one function argument didn't update as expected
- More quality control, optimize training parameters

# Fall semester plans: 
 - Shoes
    + Wrap up shoe analysis using edges and SURF 
    + Compare the performance with other methods such as phase only correlations, Fourier-Mellin transformation correlation
    + Do analysis with CSAFE shoe data
    + Submit papers regarding shoe analysis soon!
   
- Research on "uncertainty pyramid" with Steve and Hari at NIST   
 - Glass analysis with Sam
    + Exploratory analysis 
    + Various covariance estimations
    + Submit papers!
   
- Working on book chapters of glass and shoes funded by ROpenSci Fellowship

# Analysis result with CSAFE shoe data 
- All nike shoes with size of 8.5 and 10.5 at time 4 (6 months)
- KM (210) : Between replicates within IDs
- KNM (180) : Between IDs
- Methods : Edge matching with three circles and RF for score, phase-only correlation (POC), Fourier-Mellin transform correlation (FMTC)
