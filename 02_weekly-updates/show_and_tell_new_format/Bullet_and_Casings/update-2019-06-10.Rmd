# Bullet projects - Big picture 

- **data collection**

- **computational tools**

- matching lands: 

    1. crosscut identification
    2. **groove location**
    3. curvature removal
    4. alignment of signatures
    5. feature extraction
    6. matching with **trained Random Forest**

- **analysis of results**

- **communication of results**

# Update from the data collection

- **scans from bullet lands (about 20,000 total)**

    - **LAPD: 4 bullets per barrel for 526 out of 626 firearms**
    - **Variability study: ~2000 scans**
    - Hamby Sets 10, 36, 44, 224, and a clone (35 bullets each)
    - Houston test sets (6 kits with 25 bullets each)
    - Houston persistence: 8 barrels with 40 fired bullets each
    - St Louis persistence: 2 barrels with 192 fired bullets each
    - most of the CSAFE persistence study 
    
- **and cartridge cases**

    - DFSC (about 2000)
    - getting ready to scan cartridges for CSAFE persistence
    
- **shooting range**
    
    - **we were out on the range last week: barrels #4 to #7 (in record time!)**
    - **we are planning to go out to the range one more time to finish up the persistence study**

    - Getting into right format, submitting today or tomorrow!  
    
- (Kiegan and Nate) FSI Paper on advanced groove ID methods
    - Two-Class Classification Method
    - Bayesian Changepoint Method (Nate)
    - Pairwise results comparison on 3 bullet test sets   
    - Cleaning up, getting ready for submission  
    
- Future Work: Hough Transformation (Charlotte)

class: primary
# Overview

Use magnitude thresholding and Hough transform to get groove estimates

# Hough Transforms

- A computer-vision algorithm that detects aligned points in an image
- Two points on the same line in an image will have the same rho, theta in the feature space.
- Strong edges will have a lot of points along it, therefore a lot of weight at that specific point.

# Project Updates: VARIABILITY STUDY  

Goal of automated methods is to reduce human involvement in decision making.  

Some things need to be quantified about the automated bullet matching process:  
- Potential impact of different humans scanning LEAs 
- Potential impact of different machines 
- Whether differences impact raw data, processed data
- Whether differences impact matching scores

class: primary   
# Project Updates: VARIABILITY STUDY  

Data collection COMPLETE!!!!  
- 9 bullets 
    - 3 bullets each from 3 barrels
    - Hamby, Houston, CSAFE Persistence  
- 5 operators
- 2 machines
- 3-5 repetitions per operator/machine  
- ~ 2000 scans to work with.

# Project Updates  

What's up next?  
- Priority is *publishing*!!  
- Standard bullet scans  
- Thinking about framework for R&R, quality metrics   
   - Package, shiny application, etc...  
- Working on the book

class: primary
# REU projects

- REU-Sprite: automatic assessment of scan quality

- REU-csafe: re-factoring of Random Forest model with updated features

class: primary
# Scan quality assessment

- extract features from scan to determine quality:

    - Number/percentage of missing values
    - location of missing values along horizontal axis

- find good cut-offs based on marginal distribution of features

- build warning system for immediate feedback


---
class: primary
# Random forest re-factoring

- exact feature definition/calculation changed in move from bulletr to bulletxtrctr

- re-run algorithms on Hamby 252 and 173 (NIST scans) 

- compare results from old run to new run

- re-fit Random forest to Hamby 252 and 173, compare scores

- re-fit Random forest on higher-resolution scans
