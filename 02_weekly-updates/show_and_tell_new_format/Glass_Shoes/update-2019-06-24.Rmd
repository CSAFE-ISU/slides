- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

- If you are going to add an image, **create a directory** with your name within "images" folder. For example, "images/**guillermo**/sample_image.JPG"


 <img src = "images/guillermo/sample_image.JPG" width="35%"/>

Greetings from NIST! 

- *Open Forensic Science in R* book now up on my website
    * [sctyner.github.io/OpenForSciR](https://sctyner.github.io/OpenForSciR/)
    * Hopefully link to it on CSAFE website soon! 
- Work done at NIST: 
    * Draw your own CDFs & bounds (Ã  la Lund & Iyer (2017)) with a Shiny app: [sctyner.shinyapps.io/drawing-cdfs](https://sctyner.shinyapps.io/drawing-cdfs)
    * R package `dprocsim`: [github.com/sctyner/dprocsim](https://github.com/sctyner/dprocsim)
        + Simulate CDFs from Dirichlet Process Priors 
        + Has closures that output functions of those CDFs to evaluate on a grid
        + Check that they fall in your bounds (Shiny App available in package with `run_shiny()`)
        + For the priors that fit your criteria, simulate from the posteriors
        + Evaluate the posterior CDFs on a grid to get uncertainty intervals
    * Giving a talk on the *down packages and the `tidyverse` on Thursday

# RI2I Symposium

Attended the [Forensic Science Research Innovation to Implementation](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/events/2019/06/forensic-science-research-innovation-implementation-symposium-ri2i) on June 19-20. 

Major takeaways: 

- Different incentives prevent implementation of new research 
    * **Researchers**: in academia; motivated by need to publish, get grant funding; little to no incentive to expand outside of academia (very comfortable)
    * **Practitioners**: casework is top priority; no time to read research papers (even if they had perfect access to them); no incentive to learn new tools/other professional development
    * **Private sector**: don't want to invest in research unless the financial benefits are clear; lots of inherent risk in new technology
    * **Courts/Legal**: Daubert/Frye; judges cannot do their own research; who is validating the new methods; need to consider old cases decided with old tech

class: secondary 

- Need for an independent, federal institution for forensic science that will
    * Validate new methodology
    * Translate research in academia and work to implement in forensic labs 
    * Create standard methodology/SOP for new techniques, validation, etc. 
    * Help labs with their validation (tiger team)
    * Centralized accreditation 
    * Host one central place for labs to share data
    * Legal education
