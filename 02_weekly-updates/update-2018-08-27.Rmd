# Sample Slide

- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on the X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it get us to..." |

# This Summer

- Processing and cleaning Shoeprints Database
  + Vinyl pictures: Modified Python program to rename them and created R program to check that name is correct.
  + MatScan files: wrote AutoIt script to automatically extract files and made R program to name them accordingly (plus I wrote some programs to generate our own images and GIFs that will not be included in the database).
  + Surveys: wrote R code to 'clean' code, e.g., `"20% to 40%"` to `"30"`.
  
- Make changes to IRB (and there are still some pending changes)

- Registration of 3D scans of shoeprints

---
class: primary
# Plans for this Fall

- Complete adaptation of registration of 3D scans in R and perform analysis

- Complete shiny app for 2D outsole scans registration

- Write paper of the database which must include some data analysis

- Write paper on speaker recognition (w/Vianey Leos)
