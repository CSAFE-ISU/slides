# Show and Tell <br> October 30

# Sample Speaker

## South Dakota

- Clark, South Dakota is home to the world famous Mashed Potato Wrestling Contest.
- Mitchell is the home of the world's only Corn Palace, which is made of 3500 bushels of corn.
- Pierre, South Dakota is the only combination of state and capital in the U.S. that doesn't share any letters.
- Mount Rushmore took 14 years and only 1 million dollars to build.
- In Deadwood a permit is required to mix one alcoholic beverage with another. But you can mix all the beer you want.
- It is also illegal there for casinos to hang a sign saying "Casino".

## Hamby-44 Re-scan

- Hamby set 44: two test fires  each from ten consecutive barrels, 15 questioned bullets
- Hamby set 44 is part of NIST ballistics dataset
- all 35 bullets are now re-scanned with higher resolution CLM

## Hamby-44: Questioned versus known bullets

- for which bullets would you request re-scans?

## Intervals for Random Forest Predictions

- Intervals constructed from predicted probabilities from many random forest classifiers.
- Widths increase as probabilities approach 0.5.
- Similar results to modeling individual tree classifications as binomial and making intervals for each $p$.

## Previous
- Adjusted Chumbley Algorithm proposed by Hadler et al. applied to bullet signatures on all pairwise land-to-land comparisons of the Hamby scans ( a total of 85491 comparisons)
- Identified the window of optimization and window of validation for the chumbley algorithm for Bullet Signatures
for the Hamby-44 and Hamby-252.

## Profiles
- Trying to see how the chumbley algo works when profiles are used instead of signatures
- Chumbley algo uses a LOwEss smoothing with a default coarseness as 0.25, the idea is to first identify what coarseness would
give us best results in terms of type I and type II errors.
- Window of optimization and validation used is the same as identified for signatures.
