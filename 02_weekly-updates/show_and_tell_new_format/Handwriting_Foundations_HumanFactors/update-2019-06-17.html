- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

- If you are going to add an image, **create a directory** with your name within "images" folder. For example, "images/**guillermo**/sample_image.JPG"


 &lt;img src = "images/guillermo/sample_image.JPG" width="35%"/&gt;

# Summer update 

- NIJ Error Rates Grant
    - Goal: Use ROC curves to explore error rates for Two-Stage Approach
    - co-PI Larry Tang will be starting a new position at UCF
    - Working to get a No-Cost Extension so we can continue working on the grant
    - Once the NCE goes through, will need to transfer grant to UCF
    - Writing a paper on SLRs using ROC curves
    - Hoping to get Susan involved to help with visualization of ROC curves soon!
    - Writing a paper on different types of error rates for Two-Stage Approach for forensics
    - Will present some results at the SimStat conference in Austria in Sept.

# Summer update 

- NIJ Handwriting Grant
    - Goal: Determine whether examiner response regarding strength of support for common source hypotheses can be explained by the kinematic features of handwriting
    - Found 2 subsets of examiners (Symmetric and Asymmetric)
    - This means two sets of analyses needed for modeling the examiner responses
    - Using a Wasserstein distance score from LDA class predictions for Symmetric examiners
    - Using the ECDF value from both within-writer and between-writer populations of above score for Asymmetric examiners
    - Will present these results at ASQDE meeting in August
    - Draft paper on results is written!

# Summer Plans / Project Updates

- Handwriting Study Data collection  &lt;SUP&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SUP&gt;
    - Materials 
    - Recruitment 
    - Retention 
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
- Shoes
    - Some data collection 
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

# Data collection
Purpose:

- Data is to be used in an open access database and to test materials developed by CSAFE researchers

Our Goal:


- To enroll 100 participants by June 15th, 2019
- Have all sessions completed by summer's end 
- Have Amy run another set of participants in the fall

---
class: primary   
# Data Collection: Continued 
Collection:
- Three Collections  &lt;SUP&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SUP&gt;
    - First in person/video/phone 
    - Need a group of at least three to participate at a distance. 
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
- Survey 
- Three paragraphs - three reps of each
- Sign a fake name
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
- Samples are scanned once completed

class: primary   
# Recruitment 

- More difficult then previously thought  &lt;SUP&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SUP&gt;
    - Lack of participation at All Hands- 32 possible sign ups- 2 follow throughs
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
- Family, friends, mailing lists (Stats, math, CSAFE, Soc.) and old job contacts 
- Elimination of the "group of three" rule
- Recruit until we reach 95- Follow ups from there 
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
- Currently 84 participants   

- Following up 14 Possible

- Amy will continue into the Fall

# Moving Forward 

* Keeping participants enrolled through all 3 sessions

* Keeping participants organized
