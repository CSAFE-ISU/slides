# Bullet projects - Big picture 

- **data collection**

- **computational tools**

- matching lands: 

    1. crosscut identification
    2. **groove location**
    3. curvature removal
    4. alignment of signatures
    5. feature extraction
    6. matching with trained Random Forest

- **analysis of results**

- **communication of results**

# Update from the data collection

- **scans from bullet lands (about 20,000 total)**

    - LAPD: 4 bullets per barrel for **all** of 626 firearms
    - Hamby Sets 10, 36, 44, 224, and a clone (35 bullets each)
    - Houston test sets (6 kits with 25 bullets each)
    - Houston persistence: 8 barrels with 40 fired bullets each
    - St Louis persistence: 2 barrels with 192 fired bullets each
    - most of the CSAFE persistence study 
    
- **and cartridge cases**

    - DFSC (about 2000)
    - getting ready to scan cartridges for CSAFE persistence
    
- **shooting range**
    
    - we are planning to go out to the range *one* more time to finish up the persistence study

# Charlotte: groove detection

- **Goal:** To automate the process of identifying groove engraved areas of bullet scans using computer vision algorithms.

- **Process:**
  - Prep images using gradient thesholding
  - Perform a Hough Transform on edges to identify groove edges
  - Find Hough lines closest to the middle 2/3rds of the bullet scan at the top and bottom of the bullet scan

# Kiegan: variability study

Collected ~2000 scans: 
- 9 bullets, 3 each from 3 barrels  
- 6 LEAs per bullet  
- 5 operators  
- 2 machines  
- 3+ repetitions of each environmental condition

# Kiegan: variability study  
Example of all 90 repetitions for a single signature.

# Kiegan: variability study  

Initial results show: 

- Differences between barrel types
     - Deeper striations = larger machine effect  
     - More tank rash/breakoff = larger bullet effect  
- Lots of structure due to bullet
     - Each bullet marks slightly differently
     - Measured "peaks and valleys" differ

# Kiegan: variability study  

Currently working on modeling: 

- At the signature level  
    - Using all X locations, removing overall structure
    - Subsampling to each 100th X location 
         - In 5 different phases to check for consistency
         - model 1: (1, 101, 201,...)
         - model 2: (21, 121, 221,...), etc.

- Pairwise scores
    - Same-source pairwise scores 
    - Different-source pairwise scores 
         - For completeness

- Balanced with 3 repetitions   
- Hierarchically with 3-5 repetitions  
- With/without one operator

# Update on REU projects

REU-Sprite: assessment of scan quality

will add anonymized histogram of missing values in variability study

---
class: primary
# REU-CSAFE

**Goal:** Validate `bulletxtrctr` features in comparison to `bulletr` features used to fit the random forest model

**Process:**
- Get Hamby 173 and 252 scans from NIST
- Process scans to get new features using `bulletxtrctr`
- Match new features to old features - what changed?

Currently, trying to match features from Hare et al. (2016) to new features
