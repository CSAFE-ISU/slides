## Nailpolish for marking bullets

- nail polish works, but stains the mylar

## Sharpie marks also work

- they do not stain the mylar,
- and they even survive when the bullet is deformed

## To try this Week

- There is a lot of variability on the area scanned of a shoe, even within the same shoe and subject
- The alignment based on linear regression could be useful to get the initial values of a iterative method
- I will look for an algorithm that can be applied to registry binary images
