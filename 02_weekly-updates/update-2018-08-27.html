# Sample Slide

- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

class: primary
# Since last meeting:

- Training:
    * Creating new training materials for website
    * What do practitioners want? â¬ï¸ constructing a survey
    * With that knowledge, can start material development
- Contacted potential coauthors of book chapters
    * ROpenSci [Fellowship](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/02/14/announcing-2018-ropensci-fellows/): follow progress on [my blog](https://sctyner.github.io/blog.html)
    * Need several co-authors on chapters â¬ï¸ sent lots of emails
    * Once all collaborators are found, will find "case studies" 
    * Now organized in SmartSheet! (Thanks Stacy, Harlie &amp; Rachael!)
- Spent all day Friday at the "Emerging Leaders Academy" (once a month for whole school year)
    * Applied in April 2018 (Thanks Alicia!)
    * Professional development: fostering communication &amp; leadership skills

# This Summer

- Processing and cleaning Shoeprints Database
  + Vinyl pictures: Modified Python program to rename them and created R program to check that name is correct.
  + MatScan files: wrote AutoIt script to automatically extract files and made R program to name them accordingly (plus I wrote some programs to generate our own images and GIFs that will not be included in the database).
  + Surveys: wrote R code to 'clean' code, e.g., `"20% to 40%"` to `"30"`.
  
- Make changes to IRB (and there are still some pending changes)

- Registration of 3D scans of shoeprints

---
class: primary
# Plans for this Fall

- Complete adaptation of registration of 3D scans in R and perform analysis

- Complete shiny app for 2D outsole scans registration

- Write paper of the database which must include some data analysis

- Write paper on speaker recognition (w/Vianey Leos)

# Useful Things

- `bulletxtrctr` is at 98% test coverage and also has more descriptive variable names

- Tried and failed to get Shiny to record audio for the truthiness study talk-aloud pilot
    - Audio drivers + Javascript = sadness.
    - We'll just collect audio data the old fashioned way.

# Useful Things

Read a paper: 
&gt; Gwo, C.-Y., &amp; Wei, C.-H. (2016). Shoeprint retrieval: Core point alignment for pattern comparison. Science &amp; Justice, 56(5), 341-350. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scijus.2016.06.004    

- Partially implemented in R - goal is to align + impose coordinate system on a shoeprint
- Combine with identified features to get a spatial feature "map" that can identify a type of shoe
