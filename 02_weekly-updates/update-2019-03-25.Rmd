- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

# Over the Last 2 Weeks:

NIJ Grant 

- restructure into distinct phases
- complete rewrite of narrative - focus on current practitioner practice and potential to incrementally improve (instead of just enabling likelihood ratios out of the box...)
- prototype machine should be testable on Thursday!
- IRB application mostly complete - hope to submit by April 2 for review on the 16th

__still to do__: 
- finish Phase 2 narrative
- write the impact section and additional boilerplate
- finish IRB application

# Over the Last 2 Weeks:

Annual Review of Statistics Paper on Testing Statistical Graphics

- requested ~1000 things from interlibrary loan, including a book which describes statistics as a discipline somewhere between "accounting and the science of higher mathematics" 
- Overview of historical graphical testing, testing methods sections

__still to do__: 9 pages down, another 14 to go on lineups, best practices, and future research areas
