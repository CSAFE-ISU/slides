# Sample Slide

- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

- If you are going to add an image, **create a directory** with your name within "images" folder. For example, "images/**guillermo**/sample_image.JPG"


 &lt;img src = "images/guillermo/sample_image.JPG" width="35%"/&gt;

# DIC
**Context:** Formal model selection with DIC. How many grapheme types to use in modeling? &lt;br&gt;

# DIC  
**Content:**

class: primary
# DIC  
**Conclusion:**  

- Work with IT to update server
- Other model selection techniques. 
    - Compositional data. 
    - Borrow from topic modeling literature?

# Neural Networks

- Continue quality control on labeled images
    - Go through annotations to verify *all* shapes in a given polygon are labeled
- Implement image augmentation (in particular, stretching) to prevent over-fitting of specific shapes
    - Regular polygons are identified with high accuracy, but elongated polygons are not
    - Very close to being implemented!

# Scans


- Hamby set 36 scans done, &lt;span style="color:orange"&gt;analysis done, results are a bit strange&lt;/span&gt;

- Hamby clone set 224 &lt;span style="color:orange"&gt;scans done &lt;/span&gt;

- Hamby set 224 &lt;span style="color:orange"&gt;scans done &lt;/span&gt;

- &lt;span style="color:orange"&gt;Hamby set 10 arrived from St Louis, in scanning process. &lt;/span&gt;

- several other sets of bullets and cartridge cases

class: primary
# Hamby 224 - Clone

- Hamby 224 Clone

    - organized as test set: two known bullets from the same barrel are paired with an unknown
    
    - total of fifteen test sets (one for each unknown): some clones have replicates
