- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

# Spring Goals

- Submit, submit, submit! 
    * Another thesis chapter to JCGS.
    * Glass EDA paper (w/SP) to JFS (submit by end of Feb.)
    * Jury study paper to LPR
- Other research 
    * Covariance matrices for glass element concentrations
    * Keep researching uncertainty pyramid related things
    * ROpenSci fellowship book. To be released in April
- **Reading/working group sessions** 
    * **February 13th:** Presenting the process of fitting a random forest to the glass data, following the [`tidymodels`](https://github.com/tidymodels) workflow & principles. I'm open to using other data if you have it! 
    * **February 20th:** Working meeting applying the `tidymodels` principles to your own data. This could be CSAFE or other data for your research. Or, pick a dataset from the wild (try the [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) repo). Reference materials are the slides & code from the Applied ML [workshop](https://github.com/topepo/rstudio-conf-2019) at rstudio::conf and the [paper](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v028i05) from JSS on the `caret` package.

# SLR

- To review
    - Uknown source data $Y$ and known source data $X$ are normal
    - score = $(x - y)^2$
    - $\log(SLR) - \log(LR)$ is unbounded
    - Probabilities that $SLR/LR$ under $H_d$ become large with signal-to-noise ratio
         - Under $H_p$ these probabilities are much more well-behaved
- The catch...
    - Overwhelming majority of large discrepancies exist when both the SLR and LR are very small (under $H_d$)
    
- How to interpret $\frac{P(Y|SLR, H_p)}{P(Y|SLR, H_d)}$ (or $\frac{P(Y|SLR, H_d)}{P(Y|SLR, H_p)}$)?
- I think...
    - $E_Y \left[ \frac{P(Y|SLR, H_p)}{P(Y|SLR, H_d)} | H_d \right] = E_Y\left[ \frac{P(SLR|H_d)P(SLR|Y,H_p)}{P(SLR|Y, H_d)P(SLR|H_p)} | H_p \right]$

# Spring Semester Objectives
1. Provide support to Amy and Ben
  - Amy working on modellilng. I can aide by providing features and support for package as data extraction happens.
  - Ben is working on web application. I can help by providing over-arching ideas and assist with any R code that is needed for transition.
2. Continue to improve **handwriter**
  - Order letters coherently across lines
  - Add nodes at sharp turn
  - Detect loops that have multiple paths
