- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

- If you are going to add an image, **create a directory** with your name within "images" folder. For example, "images/**guillermo**/sample_image.JPG"


 <img src = "images/guillermo/sample_image.JPG" width="35%"/>

# Longitudinal Shoe Study

- Working with CSSM and Library DataShare program to get permanent DOIs for all 7 collection methods

- Created a [collection](https://iastate.figshare.com/account/home#/collections/4477757) for the study
    - Collection manuals are a separate "dataset"
    - Already uploaded: Mat scan data, film + powder, vinyl (crime scene) photos, 2d scans
    - Upload in progress: paper + powder, camera photos
    - To upload later: 3d scans (not released for at least a year)

- Fight with DataShare: Can they host data from IRB-reviewed studies?
    
- To do: write paper describing the experiment and the database(s)

# CoNNOR: Planned investigations (this summer)

- Optimal level to truncate VGG16 for transfer learning on shoes
    - Currently running Block2 truncated model on Bigfoot

- Fully convolutional neural networks - accommodate images of any size

- Region segmentation networks

- [`autokeras` R/python package](https://github.com/jcrodriguez1989/autokeras) that optimizes NN structure automatically
