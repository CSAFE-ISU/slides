# Sample Slide

- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

# Fall semester plans: 
 - Shoes
    + Wrap up shoe analysis using edges and SURF 
    + Compare the performance with other methods such as phase only correlations, Fourier-Mellin transformation correlation
    + Do analysis with CSAFE shoe data
    + Submit papers regarding shoe analysis soon!
   
- Research on "uncertainty pyramid" with Steve and Hari at NIST   
 - Glass analysis with Sam
    + Exploratory analysis 
    + Various covariance estimations
    + Submit papers!
   
- Working on book chapters of glass and shoes funded by ROpenSci Fellowship

# Analysis with CSAFE shoe data 
- POC is rotation variant!
- Try to find ways to adjust rotation bewteen two images

# Glass Analysis  
- Comparison between Standard method vs. Random forest 
- When two methods disgree,

|   | False neg.  | False pos.| True neg.  | True  pos.  |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|std| 92  |7635   |2299   |9   |
|RF | 9  |2299   |  7635 |92   |

- For false positives, std uses K (27.81\%), Li (18.62\%), Zr (14.43\%), Ba (8.98\%), Ti (6.72\%)
