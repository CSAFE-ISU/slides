# Bullet projects - Big picture 

- **data collection**

- **computational tools**

- matching lands: 

    1. crosscut identification
    2. **groove location**
    3. curvature removal
    4. alignment of signatures
    5. feature extraction
    6. matching with trained Random Forest

- **analysis of results**

- **communication of results**

# Update from the data collection

- **scans from bullet lands (about 20,000 total)**

    - LAPD: 4 bullets per barrel for **all** of 626 firearms
    - Hamby Sets 10, 36, 44, 224, and a clone (35 bullets each)
    - Houston test sets (6 kits with 25 bullets each)
    - Houston persistence: 8 barrels with 40 fired bullets each
    - St Louis persistence: 2 barrels with 192 fired bullets each
    - most of the CSAFE persistence study 
    
- **and cartridge cases**

    - DFSC (about 2000)
    - getting ready to scan cartridges for CSAFE persistence
    
- **shooting range**
    
    - we are planning to go out to the range *one* more time to finish up the persistence study
