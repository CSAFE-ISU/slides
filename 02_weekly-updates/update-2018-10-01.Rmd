# Sample Slide

- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

- If you are going to add an image, **create a directory** with your name within "images" folder. For example, "images/**guillermo**/sample_image.JPG"

- Finish package to check format of files from database
    - checksum table included?

- Study papers on pressure differences
    1. Separate shoe by areas?
    1. Normalize shoes?
    1. 1 and 2 would imply to align (but we have low resolution)

# Analysis result with CSAFE shoe data 
- All nike shoes with size of 8.5 and 10.5 at time 4 (6 months)
- KM (210) : Between replicates within IDs
- KNM (180) : Between IDs
- Methods : Edge matching with three circles and RF for score, phase-only correlation (POC), Fourier-Mellin transform correlation (FMTC)

# Sorry I can't be there today! 

Last week, I worked on:

- Debugging picture labeling for Neural Network, working through model issues
- Relabeling pictures (manual tagging)
- Bullet resampling - package works, needs to be faster
- Pestering IT about the Shoe Database frontend (sigh)
- (w/ Nick) Handwriting methods applied to fingerprints - not bad, but picture quality issues

This week:

 - More debugging of NN model
 - Refactor bullet resampling package
 - More fingerprint and shoe alignment

# More Surprises

- Class confusion matrix is informative for models from two weeks ago, but very strange for most recent models

# Image Quantity

- Might be an issue of relative quantities between classes
- May combine pentagon and hexagon
- May also augment classes proportionally
