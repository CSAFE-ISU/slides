# Longitudinal Shoe Study

- Working with CSSM and Library DataShare program to get permanent DOIs for all 7 collection methods

- Created a [collection](https://iastate.figshare.com/account/home#/collections/4477757) for the study
    - Collection manuals are a separate "dataset"
    - Already uploaded: Mat scan data, film + powder, vinyl (crime scene) photos, 2d scans
    - Upload in progress: paper + powder, camera photos
    - To upload later: 3d scans (not released for at least a year)

- Fight with DataShare: Can they host data from IRB-reviewed studies?
    
- To do: write paper describing the experiment and the database(s)

# CoNNOR: Planned investigations (this summer) {.smaller}

- Optimal level to truncate VGG16 for transfer learning on shoes
    - Currently running Block2 truncated model on Bigfoot

- Fully convolutional neural networks - accommodate images of any size

- Region segmentation networks

- [`autokeras` R/python package](https://github.com/jcrodriguez1989/autokeras) that optimizes NN structure automatically
