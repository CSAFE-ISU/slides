# Sample Slide

- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

- If you are going to add an image, **create a directory** with your name within "images" folder. For example, "images/**guillermo**/handwritten_logo.png"


 &lt;img src = "images/guillermo/handwritten_logo.png" width="65%"/&gt;

# Fall Semester Goals

- **Data Collection**
    - &lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="red"&gt;Moving (slowly).&lt;/font&gt;
- **FlashID Data**
    - &lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="red"&gt;Update install scheduled for tomorrow morning!&lt;/font&gt;
- Expand Bayesian hierarchical model
    - **Formal Model Selection**
        - &lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="red"&gt;Cleaning up code.&lt;/font&gt;
        - &lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="red"&gt;Methods other than DIC.&lt;/font&gt;
    - Tests and Intervals
    - Validation
- Write and submit a paper on that modeling.

- **IRB** The saga continues (Applting for continuing review).

- **Database** Added function to `checkshoenames` to find a specified pattern in the file names in a directory and change the name of such files.

- **Registration** Reading papers (suggested by Susan) and testing functions to register matscan images.
    - Idea: Borrowing ideas from fMRI images to find a template image within another image.

# Neural Networks

- Working on poster for Forensics@NIST and AAFS
- How to best quantify accuracy for one-hot prediction?
    - ROC-type curve for probability threshhold
- Generating heatmaps to visualize what neural networks look for
    - Generating these for our model is difficult
