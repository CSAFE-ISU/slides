# Longitudinal Data Collection

## Final Collection 

**So Far....**

* Scanning 
    + 1360 Paper prints to be scanned
    + 480 Paper Prints Scanned in a day
    + Cleaning up Storage
* Powder Prints and Impressions 
    + 1 Pair Remaining (Just Got in.)
* "Z" Drive 
    + Reviewing Errors (5438)

class: secondary

## **Challenges**
* Errors (5438):
     + Unnamed Vinyl Photos
     + Mat Scanner Files
     + Errors in Final Files
* Women's Shoes
     + 2D Scans

# This Week

* Get Paper Prints Scanned 
* Get 2D Scans completed
* Get Downloads onto the shoe desktop and laptop to fix errors

* Note: Data collection was received well at the All Hands Meeting

# SLR/LR

- May be some relationship to calibration. 
    - "The LR of the LR is the LR" comes from "The distribution of calibrated likelihood-ratios in speaker recognition" (Leeuwen and Brummer 2013). 
    - Not crystal clear on definition of calibration for LRs. 
- Thoughts from conversations with Chris Saunders at the All Hands Meeting:
    - Is this worth doing for common source propositions?
    - SLRs can behave arbitrarily poorly due to atypical anchored evidence, original dimension of data, etc. (but...)
    - Use of approximate Bayesian computation to explore computationally intractable LRs (?)
