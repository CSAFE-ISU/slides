## Bullet project - identifying grooves  

- Looking at a single crosscut from each land of Hamby 44, Hamby 252, Cary studies
- Using get_grooves (with "rollapply" method) to see how groove identification is going

## Identifying grooves - next steps  

- Instead of looking at single crosscuts ("signatures"), we will look at "data" file in database and look for multiple x values
- Check what locations get_grooves is finding
- Thinking about fitting a line to account for the angle in the grooves  


## Handwriting  

- Score based likelihood ratios (SLRs)
- Three methods
    - SLR_1 is trace-anchored $\quad\quad SLR_1 = g(\Delta(x,y)|H_p, I)$
    - SLR_2 is source-anchored
    - SLR_3 is general match ("no anchor")
