- If you are going to add an image, **create a directory** with your name within "images" folder. For example, "images/**guillermo**/sample_image.JPG"

 <img src = "images/guillermo/sample_image.JPG" width="35%"/>

# Neural Networks

- Most recent model (classifying circles vs. triangles) using VGG16 has **94.8% accuracy** on test set!
- Next questions
    - Is VGG19 (more layers) better than VGG16?
    - Effect of different classes on accuracy? (e.g., quadrilateral, text)
    - How to handle multi-class images? 
        - Binary encoding/classification for each shape
        - Multi-label neural network

# Architecture

- **Convolutional layers** learn local patterns by analyzing the image through a sliding window
- **Max-Pooling layers** combine patterns learned in single windows, downsampling huge feature maps and creating feature hierarchies of importance

# Longitudinal Data Collection
* Document Development
   + Detailed outline of all changes made during collection
   + Updates on all procedure manuals
* Automated File development
   + Mat Scanner Files
   + These should be all remaining errors
