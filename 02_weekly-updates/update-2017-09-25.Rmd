# Show and Tell <br> September 25


## Soyoung's slides 1
- Working on experiments for possible attributes for similarity score
- Known Match (KM) : 20 comparisons
- Known Non-Match (KNM) : 25 comparisons
- Average of overlap features from KM and KNM

## Nick's Slides
 - Create writing path isomorphism
 - Having trouble with loops
 - Can get paths for all other connection and limit the isomorphic graph to a simpler graph of just nodes

## Amy's Slide
- Outreach on Saturday went well!
    + 20 Science Bound students grades 9 - 11
    + 3 hands-on activities and an online quiz (NIST - Fingerprint Examiner)
- Tring to get a feel for the data that FlashID dumps out. Having trouble moving files.
- Talking with IT about handling installation issues with the FlashID VM.
- Does anyone have a shoe print case study to include with the middle school teacher resource package?

## MAFS

- Soyoung and I attended last Wednesday (2017-09-20) to the Midwestern Association of Forensic Scientists ([MAFS](http://www.mafs.net/mafs-2017-fall-meeting-homepage)) conference in Cincinnati, OH

- Specifically, these two workshops by Lesley Hammer:
    + _Ensuring Thorough and Fair Evaluation of Limitations during the Footwear Examination Process_ and 
    + _Testifying about the Methods and Foundations of Footwear Evidence_.

- Audience: mostly footwear practitioners

## MAFS

+ __Ensuring Thorough and Fair Evaluation of Limitations during the Footwear Examination Process__: 
    - Analysis of impressions (substrate, matrix, deposition, photography, collection): Clarity and reliability, limitations in conclusion

+ __Testifying about the Methods and Foundations of Footwear Evidence__:
    - Discussion on error rates, PCAST report, standards (SWTREAD & OSAC)

## Robustness of Hu moments

- Go there (Update to his slide later)

# Martin's Slides

## Update on Image Alignment
- Now its possible to align two shoeprints after selecting three matching points on each image
- Even when the transformation its done in C++, it is still a bit slow when working on the full resolution (roughly 4000x2000 pixels). Working on parallelization

## Example

<tr>
<td> <img src="images/img1_show.png" width=190> </td>
<td> <img src="images/img2_show.png" width=190> </td>
<td> <img src="images/imgt_show.png" width=190> </td>
</tr>

## 
- We need to transform all the shoeprints to the same scale, to be able to talk about the same cross section for any given shoeprint
- The Israeli Police on a report from 2016 describes an approach to deal with this problem

<tr>
<td> <img src="images/israeli_1.png" width=350> </td>
<td> <img src="images/israeli_2.png" width=400> </td>
</tr>

## 
- We have the tools to do this manually, but it does not seem hard to do it automatically (at least for the nice images from the EverOS)
- Procedure to test this week:
    + Find the dominant direction of the shoeprint (three ideas to try: Radon transformation, linear regression and principal components)
    + Find the center of the shoeprint using the sample mean of the non-zero pixels coordinates
    + Search for the first and last non-zero pixel across the found axis
