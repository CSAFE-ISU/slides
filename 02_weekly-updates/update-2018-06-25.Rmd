# Sample Slide

- Sample Graphic:

<img src="images/heike/sweden-germany.png" width = "70%">

class: secondary

- If you are going to add an image, **create a directory** with your name within "images" folder. For example, "images/**guillermo**/sample_image.JPG"

 <img src = "images/guillermo/sample_image.JPG" width="35%"/>

# SLRs

- Reading about ABC to be able to understand the papers Chris recommended to me. 
- Assuming no mistakes, $e^{E[log(SLR)|H_0]} \leq E\left[\frac{SLR}{LR} | H_0 \right]$.
    - left side is computable
    - right side is some measure of the average quality of the LR under $H_0$ 
    - still not that useful for bounding probabilities

class: secondary

$$
\begin{aligned}
E\left[\frac{SLR}{LR}|H_0\right] &= e^{log\left( E\left[\frac{SLR}{LR} | H_0 \right] \right)} \\
& \geq e^{E\left[ log\left(\frac{SLR}{LR} \right) |H_0 \right]} \\
& = e^{E\left[ log(SLR) |H_0 \right] - E\left[ log(LR) |H_0 \right]} \\
& \geq e^{E\left[ log(SLR) |H_0 \right] - log\left(E\left[ LR |H_0 \right] \right)} \\
& = e^{E\left[ log(SLR) |H_0 \right]}
\end{aligned}

# Groove ID

- Reading about changepoint detection
- Possible approach similar to some examples given in "Bayesian Retrospective Multiple-Changepoint Identification" (Stephens 1994) in JRSSc. 
    - Doesn't seem fundamentally tied to time series data

- May 31 (talk): The ABA's Ninth Annual Prescription for Criminal Justice Forensics Program in New York  

- June 5 (outreach): 4th and 5th graders for a STEM camp (thanks Jimmy!)  

- June 7 and 8 (outreach): STEMversity with middle school students in Milledgeville, GA  

- June 11-12 (meetings and poster): All Hands. Handwriting pre-meeting with the Israei team and Dr. Stern went well.

- Prelim study (next 2 weeks)  

- Handwriting after that (finally)

# Longitudinal Data Collection
## Final Collection 
* Issues with the 2D Scanner 
    + Phantom Images
    + Theoretically, wont take long
* Possible Causes
    + Past cleaning Procedures
    + Shoes (from being cleaned)
    + Finger Print Powder
* "Z" Drive 
    + Reviewing Errors (5438)

---
class: primary
# This Week
## **Moving Forward**
* Adapt to the Problem
     + Continue Cleaning and figure it out
     + Finish Data Collection

# Shoe Tread
* (Last week) Code to "carve up" tread annotations into useful pictures (using Matlab toolbox from LabelMe)

<img src="images/susan/circle-2.jpg" width = 30%/>
<img src="images/susan/circle-3.jpg" width = 30%/>

* Pictures tend to look better if the regions are square-ish

# Truthiness

* "When making rapid judgments about the truth of a claim, nonprobative images lead people to believe the claim"
    - Want to know if this holds for charts and graphs
    - Some evidence that brain images cause the person presenting the images to appear more credible in court

* Finding claims that are data-driven and can be made into a chart is hard. 

---
class:primary
# Truthiness
* First step - pilot study with ~ 10 claims
    - Claim alone
    - Claim with nonprobative, related image
    - Claim with probative data display where information is harder to pick out or lacks context (data may be encoded by color alone)
    - Claim with probative chart of explicitly numerical information
    - Claim with nonprobative, unrelated image (from a different claim)
    - Claim with nonprobative, unrelated chart (from a different claim)
