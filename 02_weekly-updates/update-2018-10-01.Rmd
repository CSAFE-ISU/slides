# Sample Slide

- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

# Sorry I can't be there today! 

Last week, I worked on:

- Debugging picture labeling for Neural Network, working through model issues
- Relabeling pictures (manual tagging)
- Bullet resampling - package works, needs to be faster
- Pestering IT about the Shoe Database frontend (sigh)
- (w/ Nick) Handwriting methods applied to fingerprints - not bad, but picture quality issues

This week:

 - More debugging of NN model
 - Refactor bullet resampling package
 - More fingerprint and shoe alignment
