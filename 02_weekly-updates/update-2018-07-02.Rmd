- If you are going to add an image, **create a directory** with your name within "images" folder. For example, "images/**guillermo**/sample_image.JPG"

 <img src = "images/guillermo/sample_image.JPG" width="35%"/>

# Groove Identification

- Time last week spent getting a feel for the bullet data
- Thinking about modeling the residuals from robust loess using piecewise Gaussian processes
    - major computational issues to this approach
        - demands modification to approach taken in the JRSSc paper 
        - I think there are a couple of reasonable remedies for this issue, but I've heard of more in the literature.
    - Going to try a proof of concept on bullet data with sampled subsets of residuals.
