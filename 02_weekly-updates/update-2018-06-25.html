# Sample Slide

- Sample Table:

| Team     | Group | W   | D   | L   |
| : ------ | :---- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Germany  | F     | 1   | 0   | 1   |
| Mexico   | F     | 2   | 0   | 0   |
| Sweden   | F     | 1   | 0   | 1   |
| S. Korea | F     | 0   | 0   | 2   |

# Sample Slide

- Sample Graphic:

&lt;img src="images/heike/sweden-germany.png" width = "70%"&gt;

class: secondary

- If you are going to add an image, **create a directory** with your name within "images" folder. For example, "images/**guillermo**/sample_image.JPG"

 &lt;img src = "images/guillermo/sample_image.JPG" width="35%"/&gt;

# SLRs

- Reading about ABC to be able to understand the papers Chris recommended to me. 
- Assuming no mistakes, `\(e^{E[log(SLR)|H_0]} \leq E\left[\frac{SLR}{LR} | H_0 \right]\)`.
    - left side is computable
    - right side is some measure of the average quality of the LR under `\(H_0\)` 
    - still not that useful for bounding probabilities

---
class: secondary

`$$\begin{aligned}
E\left[\frac{SLR}{LR}|H_0\right] &amp;= e^{log\left( E\left[\frac{SLR}{LR} | H_0 \right] \right)} \\
&amp; \geq e^{E\left[ log\left(\frac{SLR}{LR} \right) |H_0 \right]} \\
&amp; = e^{E\left[ log(SLR) |H_0 \right] - E\left[ log(LR) |H_0 \right]} \\
&amp; \geq e^{E\left[ log(SLR) |H_0 \right] - log\left(E\left[ LR |H_0 \right] \right)} \\
&amp; = e^{E\left[ log(SLR) |H_0 \right]}
\end{aligned}$$`

# Groove ID

- Reading about changepoint detection
- Possible approach similar to some examples given in "Bayesian Retrospective Multiple-Changepoint Identification" (Stephens 1994) in JRSSc. 
    - Doesn't seem fundamentally tied to time series data

# What I'm Working On  

- I have been banned from working on my paper and the book until after the prelim  
- Prelim is in two weeks!

# What I've been up to:
      
- May 31 (talk): The ABA's Ninth Annual Prescription for Criminal Justice Forensics Program in New York  

- June 5 (outreach): 4th and 5th graders for a STEM camp (thanks Jimmy!)  

- June 7 and 8 (outreach): STEMversity with middle school students in Milledgeville, GA  

- June 11-12 (meetings and poster): All Hands. Handwriting pre-meeting with the Israei team and Dr. Stern went well.

class: primary
# Next:  
      
&lt;br /&gt;  
&lt;br /&gt;  


- Prelim study (next 2 weeks)  

- Handwriting after that (finally)  

- July 31 (talk - handwriting): JSM
- August 19-23 (poster? talk? maybe?): The American Society of Questioned Document Examiners (ASQDE)

# Longitudinal Data Collection
## Final Collection 
* Issues with the 2D Scanner 
    + Phantom Images
    + Theoretically, wont take long
* Possible Causes
    + Past cleaning Procedures
    + Shoes (from being cleaned)
    + Finger Print Powder
* "Z" Drive 
    + Reviewing Errors (5438)

---
class: primary
# This Week
## **Moving Forward**
* Adapt to the Problem
     + Continue Cleaning and figure it out
     + Finish Data Collection

# Working on

## Shoe Tread Classification

* 668 shoes partially/fully classified as of 10am

## Longitudinal shoe project

* Helped Miranda scan shoes Thursday/Friday

# Shoe Tread

* (2 weeks ago) set up LabelMe docker container to classify shoes

![LabelMe Interface](images/susan/LabelMe.png)

---
class:primary
# Shoe Tread
* (Last week) Code to "carve up" tread annotations into useful pictures (using Matlab toolbox from LabelMe)

&lt;img src="images/susan/circle-1.jpg" width = 30%/&gt;
&lt;img src="images/susan/circle-2.jpg" width = 30%/&gt;
&lt;img src="images/susan/circle-3.jpg" width = 30%/&gt;

* Pictures tend to look better if the regions are square-ish
    
&lt;img src="images/susan/line-1.jpg" width = 30%/&gt;

# Truthiness

* "When making rapid judgments about the truth of a claim, nonprobative images lead people to believe the claim"
    - Want to know if this holds for charts and graphs
    - Some evidence that brain images cause the person presenting the images to appear more credible in court

* Finding claims that are data-driven and can be made into a chart is hard. 

---
class:primary
# Truthiness
* First step - pilot study with ~ 10 claims    
Variables: 
    - Related/Not Related to claim
    - Probative/Non-probative
    - Level of Abstraction
        - High: statistical/data chart
        - Low: map/"infographic" that uses "common knowledge" as a baseline
        - Image (no data at all)
        
Prediction: more abstraction = lower familiarity, so non-probative abstract images will produce less of an effect.

- Starting neural network training soon with labeled images
  - Thanks, Jenny and Ben!
- Brainstorming facts for truthiness
