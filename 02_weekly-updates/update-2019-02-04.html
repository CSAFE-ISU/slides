- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

# Vest prints
- Variations : 6 weights &amp; 5 pairs of shoes (ID) &amp; 2 sides of shoes (Left and Right) &amp; 5 repeated impressions for each side 

  * KM : repeated measurements within a shoe ID 
  * KNM 1 : Fix weight - between shoe IDs
  * KNM 2 : Fix shoe 01 - between six weights
  * KNM 2-ID5 : Fix shoe ID 05 - between six weights
  * KNM 3 : shoe ID 1 vs shoe ID 2:5 on six weights

# Vest prints
- Explains why there is bimodal desity in KNM2 scores. 

  * KNM 2 : Fix shoe 01, side L- matches between six weights (J1, J2, J3, G1, G2, G3)
