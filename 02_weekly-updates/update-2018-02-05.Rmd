## Bullet collection

- On Friday we finished collecting bullets from the ten new Sig Sauer hand guns.
- 1,270 bullets and cartridge cases from ten different barrels
- start collecting for ten Smith & Wessons (confiscated by DCI Ankeny)
- scanning

## Results from first couple of scans

Bullet lands don't have very deep marks, but scans look OK
