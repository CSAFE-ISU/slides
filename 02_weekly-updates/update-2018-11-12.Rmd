# Sample Slide

- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

- If you are going to add an image, **create a directory** with your name within "images" folder. For example, "images/**guillermo**/sample_image.JPG"


 <img src = "images/guillermo/sample_image.JPG" width="35%"/>

# SLR

- Continuing to write up results based on the simple normal example
    - Probability that SLR/LR is large depends on the ratio of between and within source variances as well as the rarity of the known source
    - Probabilities are large under the defense hypothesis and small under the prosecution
    - Distribution of SLR/LR under the defense hypothesis is highly skewed
    - Does it matter if $SLR/LR > 10000$ when $LR \approx 2 \times 10^{-35}$

# Groove ID

- bulletcp package is passing Travis-CI 
- Model and estimation procedure is written up in the vignette. 
- Working on the data preprocessing section. 
- Additional work will probably only be necessary for the vignette, not for the JFS paper.
