## MAFS

- Soyoung and I attended last Wednesday (2017-09-20) to the Midwestern Association of Forensic Scientists ([MAFS](http://www.mafs.net/mafs-2017-fall-meeting-homepage)) conference in Cincinnati, OH

- Specifically, these two workshops by Lesley Hammer:
    + _Ensuring Thorough and Fair Evaluation of Limitations during the Footwear Examination Process_ and 
    + _Testifying about the Methods and Foundations of Footwear Evidence_.

- Audience: mostly footwear practitioners

## MAFS

+ __Ensuring Thorough and Fair Evaluation of Limitations during the Footwear Examination Process__: 
    - Analysis of impressions (substrate, matrix, deposition, photography, collection): Clarity and reliability, limitations in conclusion

+ __Testifying about the Methods and Foundations of Footwear Evidence__:
    - Discussion on error rates, PCAST report, standards (SWTREAD & OSAC)

## Robustness of Hu moments

- Go there (Update to his slide later)
