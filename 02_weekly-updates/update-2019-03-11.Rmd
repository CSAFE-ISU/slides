- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

- If you are going to add an image, **create a directory** with your name within "images" folder. For example, "images/**guillermo**/sample_image.JPG"


 <img src = "images/guillermo/sample_image.JPG" width="35%"/>

# ~~Spring Semester~~ March Goals

Working almost exclusively on the *Open Forensic Science in R* book. 

**If I emailed you about it, please get back to me ASAP. Heike and I want to make sure all of CSAFE's R packages are included.** 

I was at the [Chicago R Unconference](https://chirunconf.github.io/) this weekend and I'm off today. It was really fun! We wrote an [Unconf Toolbox](https://github.com/unconf-toolbox) for other people interested in hosting their own R unconf, and we are now going to apply for [an ISC grant](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/call-for-proposals) from the R Consortium to expand the project. (That bit was [H. Wick's idea](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/1105048536066990081))

See you tomorrow!

# Last Week

- NIJ Grant Proposal
    - Prototype machine will be ready after Spring Break  - "land mine actuated camera"
    
    - Series of emails with SoleMate about possibility of creating an API, but they don't have the resources right now.
    
    - Reframing proposal in terms of immediate utility to practitioners    
    <div class="small">Iowa DCI doesn't use SoleMate - if they examine a shoe, it's because they've already recovered a suspect's physical shoe. They aren't looking to see what shoes could have made any given print.</div>
    
- `x3ptools` - update testing for add_grid_x3p. Test coverage is back at 98% (or was when I wrote this)
