- **computational tools**

- matching lands: 

    1. crosscut identification
    2. **groove location**
    3. curvature removal
    4. alignment of signatures
    5. feature extraction
    6. matching with trained Random Forest

- **analysis of results**

- **communication of results**

# Update from the data collection

- **scans from bullet lands (about 20,000 total)**

    - LAPD: 4 bullets per barrel for 426 out of 626 firearms
    - Hamby Sets 10, 36, 44, 224, and a clone (35 bullets each)
    - Houston test sets (6 kits with 25 bullets each)
    - Houston persistence: 8 barrels with 40 fired bullets each
    - St Louis persistence: 2 barrels with 192 fired bullets each
    - most of the CSAFE persistence study 
    
- **and cartridge cases**

    - DFSC (about 2000)
    - getting ready to scan cartridges for CSAFE persistence
    
- **shooting range**
    
    - we are planning to go out to the range one more time to finish up the persistence study

# Computational tools

- **fix3p**:  Chrome extension by Talen Fisher

    demo

- **x3ptools**

    - on CRAN in version 0.0.2 since Mar 27
    
    - working with masks: color images overlaid on top of the rendered scan surface
    
&lt;img src = "heike/land-markup.png" border="2"/&gt;

---
class: primary
# x3ptools

- change to the structure: x3p objects now have a slot called `mask` (raster image)

  
- **new functions**

  - `x3p_add_mask`: for a new mask (you shouldn't need that), but you can make changes to the mask with any image operation

  - `x3p_snapshot (file)`: save a snapshot of the active rgl device  in a (png) file

  - `x3p_darker`, `x3p_lighter`: darken/lighten the active rgl device
  
  - `x3p_show_xml`, `x3p_modify_xml()`: show and modify elements of the meta file

---
class: primary
# x3ptools

- **word of caution**:

  the addition of masks to `x3ptools` has impacts on a lot of other functionality. 

     - `sample_x3p` works fine (mask is being sub-sampled)
     
     - `y_flip_x3p` does NOT flip the mask. This is a bug and will be fixed.
  
  Please watch out for strange behavior and report.


- **immediate future changes**:

  all functions of the form `xxx_x3p` will be changed to `x3p_xxx`

# User Interfaces #1

*User Interface for the batching transformations on land images, striation extraction and batching*
  - Data generation, Initial Diagnostics for visualization
  - Process involves
    - View a sample bullet land
    - Identify the problems in scaling, transformations, or anyother issues
    - Select all bullet folders with corresponding lands that you seek to compare
    - Rectify or make changes to the sample, Batch operation

# Book Chapter

- *Working on draft for a Book Chapter on Toolmarks*
  - Brief Introduction to toolmarks in forensics
  - Implementations in R and a brief overview of the algorithmic working of
   the chumbley score methods (Krishnan-Hofmann; Hadler-Morris)
  - One data set from Ames lab on screwdriver marks available

# Chumbley Non-random Bullet-to-Bullet scoring

*Chumbley Non-random Bullet-to-Bullet scoring* 
  - Expansion of the last paper 
  - Collecting all runs form previous paper

*To do*
  - Getting the results of the two most significant steps of the algorithm
  - Bullet wise land matching and then bullet to bullet sequential land matching (or n)
  - Coerce all windows corresponding to 6 lands of a bullet into a new nonparametric statistical test for bullets.

# Project Updates: VARIABILITY STUDY  

Goal of automated methods is to reduce human involvement in decision making.  

Some things need to be quantified about the automated bullet matching process:  
- Potential impact of different humans scanning LEAs 
- Potential impact of different machines 
- Whether differences impact raw data, processed data
- Whether differences impact matching scores


---
class: primary   
# Project Updates: VARIABILITY STUDY  

Data collection COMPLETE!!!!  
- 9 bullets 
    - 3 bullets each from 3 barrels
    - Hamby, Houston, CSAFE Persistence  
- 5 operators
- 2 machines
- 3-5 repetitions per operator/machine  
- ~ 2000 scans to work with.

# Overview


- **Past Method**: Used magnitude thresholding and watershed segmentation to find LEAs

- **Current Method**: Use magnitude thresholding and Hough transform to get groove estimates

# Hough Transforms

- A computer-vision algorithm that detects aligned points in an image
- Two points appear on the same line in an image will have intersecting lines in the feature space.
- Strong edges will have a lot of points along it, therefore a lot of intersections at that specific point.
