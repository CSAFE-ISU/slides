## Classifying Shoe Tread Patterns

- Script to pull images of shoe tread off of Zappos (1920x1440)
    - Runs daily at 3am and 9pm
- Another script to 
    1. Crop the picture
    2. Edge detect
    3. Flip the picture (sometimes)
    4. Slice the picture up into 64x64, 128x128, 256x256 chunks
    5. Remove any images that are mostly white pixels

## Classifying Shoe Tread Patterns

- 1392 large photos
- 5668 images to slice (edge detect + flip combinations)
- 1788438 image slices
- MySQL database to manage tracking the images

## Shiny app - ShoeSortR

## Coming Up

- Establish better threshold for images with too many white pixels
- Filter images so that there aren't so many
- Establish whether 64x64 is too small to be useful
- Use the Shiny app to rate a LOT of pictures
