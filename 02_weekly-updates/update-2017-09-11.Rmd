## Jason Saporta

I spent the summer at Credit Suisse making models for predicting loan defaults, prepayments, etc. Not much connection with CSAFE unless you believe everybody on Wall St. is a criminal.

During the past week I implemented a neural network for matching bullet signatures. Everything's running well, but no serious results yet.

Plans for this week:
- Maybe actually getting results for the aforementioned model
- Replicating studies on CNN effectiveness for stego problems
- Reading more about recent developments in Bayesian ML and determining if that could help with my research
