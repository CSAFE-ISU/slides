# Sample Slide

- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

- If you are going to add an image, **create a directory** with your name within "images" folder. For example, "images/**guillermo**/sample_image.JPG"


 &lt;img src = "images/guillermo/sample_image.JPG" width="35%"/&gt;

# Fall Semester Goals

- `x3ptools` and `bulletxtrctr`
    - \&gt; 95% test coverage     
    **(81%, 97% respectively)**
    - Results database - data provenance     
    **still in progress - Talen &amp; Rishab**
    - Docker or packrat to ensure environment reproducibility
- Truthiness study data collection     
**Pilot study done - transcribing audio recordings**

class: primary
# Fall Semester Goals

- Paper with Miranda (Creative Component):    
one-hot Convolutional NN for shoeprint feature recognition    
**Model working relatively well, paper in beginning stages**
- Longitudinal Shoeprint Database
    - Functioning well enough to present at AAFS in Feb    
    **getting there**
- *Bullet papers*
    - *Case study validation* **(almost done)**
    - *Resampling* **(about 40% done)**

# Last Couple of Weeks

- Truthiness: Pilot data done! 
    - Transcription of audio recordings: 5/41 as of 1pm
    - Initial findings: 
        1. People don't know basic geography
        2. Logical statements are hard - "Less than 85% have access to electricity" interpreted as:
            - less than 85% have access to electricity
            - less than 15% have access to electricity
            - more than 15% have access to electricity
            - more than 85% don't have access to electricity
            - and more...
- Case Study Validation paper
    - Designing a template that works with arcane JFS formatting requirements
- `bulletxtrctr` tests for groove-finding functions from Nate and Kiegan
