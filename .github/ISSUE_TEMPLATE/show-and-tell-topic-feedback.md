name: Show and Tell Topic Feedback
about: 'If you brought an issue, problem, etc. needing feedback from the group, use
  this form to document the discussion. '

---

To propose a discussion topic, make sure you include brief descriptions of: 

- problem context (what do we need to know before providing feedback?)
- the specific problem / topic on which you'd like feedback (how can we help?)
- a "so what?" (why is this important to your project?)
