- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:

| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |

# Data Collection: Continued 
Collection:
- Three Collections  <SUP>&nbsp;</SUP>
    - First in person/video/phone 
    - Need a group of at least three to participate at a distance. 
<br /> <br />
- Survey 
- Three paragraphs - three reps of each
- Sign a fake name
<br /> <br />
- Samples are scanned once completed

# Recruitment 

- More difficult then previously thought  <SUP>&nbsp;</SUP>
    - Lack of participation at All Hands- 32 possible sign ups- 2 follow throughs
<br /> <br />
- Family, friends, mailing lists (Stats, math, CSAFE, Soc.) and old job contacts 
- Elimination of the "group of three" rule
- Recruit until we reach 95- Follow ups from there 
<br /> <br />
- Currently 84 participants   

- Following up 14 Possible

- Amy will continue into the Fall
