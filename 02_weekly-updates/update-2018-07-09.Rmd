- If you are going to add an image, **create a directory** with your name within "images" folder. For example, "images/**guillermo**/sample_image.JPG"

 <img src = "images/guillermo/sample_image.JPG" width="35%"/>

# Neural Networks

- Most recent model (classifying circles vs. triangles) using VGG16 has **94.8% accuracy** on test set!
- Next questions
    - Is VGG19 (more layers) better than VGG16?
    - Effect of different classes on accuracy? (e.g., quadrilateral, text)
    - How to handle multi-class images? 
        - Binary encoding/classification for each shape
        - Multi-label neural network

# Architecture

- **Convolutional layers** learn local patterns by analyzing the image through a sliding window
- **Max-Pooling layers** combine patterns learned in single windows, downsampling huge feature maps and creating feature hierarchies of importance

# Truthiness

- 6 facts down, 6 more to go
- 10 pictures/plots per fact
- Formalized the experimental design

It's surprisingly hard to find specific bits of data, such as the length of a border with a body of water. :-/

# Bullet Changepoint
 - Changepoint analysis with Gibbs is currently running
    - Currently the samples is a two step, random walk Metropolis within Gibbs.
 - Preliminary results on next few slides
---
class: secondary
- Vertical lines show posterior means of the changepoints
- So far, so good.

Handwriting
- Assigned a total of 54 documents from 9 different writers to classify handwritten letters.
- In a week, I have completed 8/54 documents.

Errors: 
- Can only select a "square" region.
- Some letters overlap with the next letter in the word.
