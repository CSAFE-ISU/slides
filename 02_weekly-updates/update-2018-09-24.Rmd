# Sample Slide

- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

- If you are going to add an image, **create a directory** with your name within "images" folder. For example, "images/**guillermo**/sample_image.JPG"

# Fall semester plans: 
 - Shoes
    + Wrap up shoe analysis using edges and SURF 
    + Compare the performance with other methods such as phase only correlations, Fourier-Mellin transformation correlation
    + Do analysis with CSAFE shoe data
    + Submit papers regarding shoe analysis soon!
   
- Research on "uncertainty pyramid" with Steve and Hari at NIST   
 - Glass analysis with Sam
    + Exploratory analysis 
    + Various covariance estimations
    + Submit papers!
   
- Working on book chapters of glass and shoes funded by ROpenSci Fellowship

# Analysis result with CSAFE shoe data 
 - All nike shoes with size of 8.5 and 10.5 at time 4 (6 months)
- KM (716) : Between replicates
- KNM (599) : Between shoe IDs
- Edge matching with three circles

# Bullets

- Hamby 44 analysis - compare Hamby 36 to Hamby 44
    - ~~Hopefully will be finished later today~~     
    Finished last Monday. Results are a little weird, but not too bad.
- Resampling with `bulletsamplr` package:     
Use time-series bootstrap methods that ensure continuity (threshold bootstrap) to build a bullet signature using pieces of previously generated signatures
    - Did this week: Got a database of cycles populated with Hamby 36 and Hamby 44 signatures
    - Short term goal: Get the methods working
    - Long term goal: Calculate truly "random" match score statistics to get null distributions

# Image Alignment

- `ShoeAlignR` package renamed to `ImageAlignR` 
    - useful for fingerprints as well
    <!-- - algorithms aren't working with color images yet... not sure why -->
- Implemented an alignment algorithm from a [Kaggle post](https://www.kaggle.com/vicensgaitan/image-registration-the-r-way/notebook)
    - Harris Corner detection + KNN features + RANSAC to find a matching transformation for alignment
    - Added SURF feature detector from `image.dlib` package

- Orange points - interesting feature for the first image
- Purple points - similar feature in 2nd image

# Image Alignment

<img src = "images/susan/ShoeOverlayNikeByCheckin.png" width = "100%"/>
- Red = appears in warped image only
- Blue = appears in unwarped image only
- Black = appears in both images (overlapped points)

# Image Alignment

- Still to do:
    - ~~Need to add a better feature detector - corner detection misses some shoe features~~
    - Figure out whether the algorithm isn't working on certain shoes:
        - Image cleaning?
        - Poor feature detection?
        - Different people wearing the shoes?
            - The algorithm does much better when aligning shoes at the same timepoint (but still isn't perfect)
    - Get the algorithm working on color images
    - Use on fingerprint data

class: primary
# Neural Networks

- Add features to shiny app that facilitate debugging/fixing labels
    - Chunk image linked directly to LabelMe page for the shoe
- Automate generation of labeled images (at 5pm daily) and integrate with model script
    - Shrink large regions down instead of slicing them up
    - No more filling in white pixels with the mean pixel value
- New model is fit every night after image generation is done
