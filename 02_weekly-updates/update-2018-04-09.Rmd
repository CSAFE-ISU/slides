## Book Progress & Modeling & Writeups, Oh My!  

1. **Chapman and Hall book**: Progress! Did a lot of research and some writing. Rounding out the chapter this week.  
2. **Grooves Writeup**:  Started a write-up of methods we are trying for groove identification  
3. **Modeling**: Trying out a new method. First predicting whether a groove is there or not!  
4. **Hands-On Stuff**: Going through and identifying where there are grooves/where there are not for test set.  
5. **Reading Group Talk!**: On NIJ Fellowships. Get excited!   
6. Plots coming next week... :)

## Bivariate SLR Weirdness
  - score(x,y) = (|x - y|, |y|)
  - x is the known source measurement
  - y is the unknown trace measurement

## Cleaning

Stentiford, Fred and R. G. Mortimer. “Some new heuristics for thinning binary handprinted characters for OCR.” IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics SMC-13 (1983): 81-84.

- Implement pre-processing from the paper above.
- 13 steps based on masks
- Goals: Remove "spurrious projections", fill "noise holes", limit "necking effect", eliminate "acute angle tails"
     - Current processing fills "noise holes" only
- All of this is done with the goal of making processing more robust so differences in thinned writing come from writing, not processing.
