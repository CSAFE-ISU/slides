- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

- If you are going to add an image, **create a directory** with your name within "images" folder. For example, "images/**guillermo**/sample_image.JPG"


 <img src = "images/guillermo/sample_image.JPG" width="35%"/>

# Spring Goals

- Submit, submit, submit! 
    * Another thesis chapter to JCGS.
    * Glass EDA paper (w/SP) to JFS (submit by end of Feb.)
    * Jury study paper to LPR
- Other research 
    * Covariance matrices for glass element concentrations
    * Keep researching uncertainty pyramid related things
    * ROpenSci fellowship book. To be released in April
- **Reading/working group sessions** 
    * **February 13th:** Presenting the process of fitting a random forest to the glass data, following the [`tidymodels`](https://github.com/tidymodels) workflow & principles. I'm open to using other data if you have it! 
    * **February 20th:** Working meeting applying the `tidymodels` principles to your own data. This could be CSAFE or other data for your research. Or, pick a dataset from the wild (try the [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) repo). Reference materials are the slides & code from the Applied ML [workshop](https://github.com/topepo/rstudio-conf-2019) at rstudio::conf and the [paper](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v028i05) from JSS on the `caret` package.
