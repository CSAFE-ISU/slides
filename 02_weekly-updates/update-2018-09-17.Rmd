- Sample Table. Sam Tyner talked about the three must-haves of your summary:



| Must-have | It means |
| :------   | :------- |
| Context | Why are you doing what you're doing? "I'm working on X project in order to Y" |
| Content | What are you doing? "I wrote X function that does Y" or "I ran a simulation of Z" |
| Conclusion | What did you learn? "This will help me because it..." or "This important because it gets us to..." |

# Image Alignment

- `ShoeAlignR` package renamed to `ImageAlignR` 
    - useful for fingerprints as well
    - algorithms aren't working with color images yet... not sure why
- Implemented an alignment algorithm from a [Kaggle post](https://www.kaggle.com/vicensgaitan/image-registration-the-r-way/notebook)
    - Harris Corner detection + KNN features + RANSAC to find a matching transformation for alignment

# Image Alignment

- Still to do:
    - Need to add a better feature detector - corner detection misses some shoe features
    - Figure out whether the algorithm isn't working on certain shoes:
        - Image cleaning?
        - Poor feature detection?
        - Different people wearing the shoes?

# Groove ID
- Version 2 of changepoint algorithm running 
- Still undergoing some testing and seeing some bizarre behavior, which may be due to some very small technical issues.
- After these issues are resolved, I'll run the algorithm on all of Hamby and Houston.

class: primary
# SLR
- Using "mutual information" between the distribution of the data given a score vs the unconditional distribution of the data to measure information loss 
    - Can estimate this numerically
- I think that this can be maximized wrt the empirical distribution for the original data with a linear program
- Then the distribution of log(LR) - log(SLR) could be computed numerically
- Lots of (small?) issues
